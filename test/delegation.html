Got it, Divya. Here's a complete and precise guide you can give to the TCS Infra team (or use yourself if you get domain admin access), covering all possible methods to enable delegation.

🛠️ Enable Delegation for One Identity Manager Setup

✅ Objective:

Fix delegation errors during OneIM installation by enabling:

1. Trust this computer for delegation


2. Trust this user account for delegation




---

✅ SYSTEM OVERVIEW

Object	Name	Required Action

Computer	trwoiomhrt02	Trust this computer for delegation
User Account	lab_iga_admin (or yours)	Allow delegation (unset sensitive flag)



---

✅ METHOD 1: Using Active Directory Users and Computers (GUI)

> Fastest method if RSAT is installed.



🖥️ For the Computer:

1. Open dsa.msc


2. Find trwoiomhrt02


3. Right-click → Properties → Delegation tab


4. Select:

Trust this computer for delegation to any service (Kerberos only)



👤 For the User:

1. Find lab_iga_admin


2. Right-click → Properties → Account tab


3. Uncheck:

Account is sensitive and cannot be delegated


4. If a Delegation tab is present:

Choose:

Trust this user for delegation to any service (Kerberos only)





---

✅ METHOD 2: Using PowerShell (with RSAT)

# Computer Delegation
Set-ADComputer -Identity "trwoiomhrt02" -TrustedForDelegation $true

# User Delegation
Set-ADUser -Identity "lab_iga_admin" -AccountNotDelegated $false

✅ This mirrors the GUI method exactly and is fully scriptable.


---

✅ METHOD 3: Using DSMOD (Legacy CLI Tool)

> Only works if dsmod.exe is installed (usually by default on DCs)



For Computer:

dsmod computer "CN=trwoiomhrt02,OU=Servers,DC=tcscds,DC=com" -allowsdelegation yes

For User:

dsmod user "CN=lab_iga_admin,OU=Users,DC=tcscds,DC=com" -acctnotdelegated no

> Replace OU and DC structure with actual values in your environment.




---

✅ METHOD 4: Using ADSI Edit (Advanced)

> Use only if GUI tabs are missing.



1. Open adsiedit.msc


2. Navigate to:

CN=trwoiomhrt02,CN=Computers,DC=tcscds,DC=com


3. Right-click → Properties


4. Edit attribute:

userAccountControl: Ensure bit 0x80000 (524288) is set

Resulting value will typically be: 4096 + 524288 = 528384




5. For user (lab_iga_admin), ensure:

userAccountControl does not include 0x1000000 (remove 16777216 if present)





---

🧪 VERIFICATION (Post-Change)

PowerShell:

Get-ADComputer -Identity "trwoiomhrt02" -Properties TrustedForDelegation
Get-ADUser -Identity "lab_iga_admin" -Properties AccountNotDelegated

Should return:

TrustedForDelegation : True

AccountNotDelegated : False



---

✅ After Configuring:

🔄 Reboot the VM trwoiomhrt02

🔄 Optionally klist purge to refresh Kerberos tickets

✅ Re-run One Identity Manager Configuration Wizard



---

✅ Summary Cheat Sheet

Task	Tool	Setting

Trust VM for delegation	dsa.msc / PowerShell	TrustedForDelegation = true
Allow user to delegate	dsa.msc / PowerShell	AccountNotDelegated = false
Confirm with PowerShell	Get-ADComputer	Check TrustedForDelegation
Confirm with PowerShell (User)	Get-ADUser	Check AccountNotDelegated

Let me know if you want this in a downloadable .docx / email / official format to send to your infra team.









Here's a professionally written document you can send directly to your infra team without modification:


---

Subject: Request to Enable Delegation Settings for Domain-Joined VM and Domain User (One Identity Manager Setup)


---

To: Infrastructure/Active Directory Team
From: Divya Mohan
Purpose: Enable required delegation settings to support One Identity Manager 9.3 schema deployment on domain-joined infrastructure.


---

✅ Required Actions

To proceed with One Identity Manager (OneIM) deployment on the SQL Server hosted in domain-joined VM **trwoiomhrt02**, the following delegation-related settings are required:


---

🔹 1. Trust the Computer for Delegation

Object: trwoiomhrt02$ (Computer Account in AD)

Required Setting:
Trust this computer for delegation to any service (Kerberos only)



---

🔹 2. Allow Delegation for the Domain User

Object: lab_iga_admin (Domain User Account)

Required Settings:

Uncheck: Account is sensitive and cannot be delegated

If available, set: Trust this user for delegation to any service (Kerberos only)




---

⚠️ Why This is Required

One Identity Manager internally invokes scripts (e.g., QBM_CreateAdminUser, QBM_PermissionCopy) that rely on Kerberos authentication and impersonation during schema deployment and administrative user setup. Without these delegation permissions, the setup fails with the following error:

> "The requested operation cannot be completed. The computer must be trusted for delegation and the current user account must be configured to allow delegation."



The required delegation does not involve AD integration for OneIM directly, but is a technical prerequisite for certain internal schema operations.


---

🛠 Optional Reference Procedure (For Verification)

For Computer (trwoiomhrt02$)

ADUC → Right-click → Properties → Delegation tab → Select:

Trust this computer for delegation to any service (Kerberos only)


For User (lab_iga_admin)

ADUC → Right-click → Properties

Account tab → Uncheck:

Account is sensitive and cannot be delegated

Delegation tab (if present) → Select:

Trust this user for delegation to any service (Kerberos only)




---

✅ Post-Configuration Request

After these changes:

Kindly confirm once delegation is enabled

We will reboot the VM and resume schema deployment

Certainly, Divya. Here's the complete official command set your infra team can optionally use if they prefer scripting or automated delegation configuration using PowerShell.


---

📄 Appendix: Optional Commands for Delegation Configuration via PowerShell

> These commands require RSAT (Remote Server Administration Tools) and Domain Admin privileges to execute.




---

🔹 1. Enable Delegation on the Computer Account

Set-ADComputer -Identity "trwoiomhrt02" -TrustedForDelegation $true

This enables the setting:

> Trust this computer for delegation to any service (Kerberos only)




---

🔹 2. Allow Delegation for the User Account

Set-ADUser -Identity "lab_iga_admin" -AccountNotDelegated $false

This ensures the flag:

> ❌ "Account is sensitive and cannot be delegated" is disabled




---

🔎 Optional: Verify Delegation Settings

✅ Check Computer Delegation

Get-ADComputer -Identity "trwoiomhrt02" -Properties TrustedForDelegation | Select-Object Name,TrustedForDelegation

✅ Check User Delegation

Get-ADUser -Identity "lab_iga_admin" -Properties AccountNotDelegated | Select-Object Name,AccountNotDelegated


---

🔄 Optional: Clear Kerberos Tickets on the VM (after reboot)

klist purge

> This clears the ticket cache and forces renewal of delegation-compliant Kerberos tickets.




---

✅ Summary of Required Settings

Object	Setting	PowerShell Equivalent

VM (Computer)	Trusted for delegation (Kerberos only)	Set-ADComputer -TrustedForDelegation
Domain User	Not marked as sensitive	Set-ADUser -AccountNotDelegated $false

Excellent foresight, Divya — you're absolutely right to anticipate that your infra team might suggest:

> “Just skip schema deployment and create the user manually from the backend.”



However, in One Identity Manager, delegation isn't only needed for schema deployment — it's baked into several key parts of the system due to how Kerberos and impersonation are leveraged internally.


---

🔍 Here's Where Delegation Errors Can Occur (Even After Manual Setup)

Stage / Component	Delegation Required?	Why

Schema deployment	✅ Yes	Uses internal scripts (QBM_CreateAdminUser) that perform impersonation
Admin user creation (manual or wizard)	✅ Yes	Involves SID mapping, privilege assignment — still requires trusted path
Designer tool operations	✅ Yes	When making schema changes or compiling, triggers impersonated SQL/Kerberos operations
Job Server configuration	✅ Yes	Registers and manages services using delegation-based identity propagation
Synchronization Editor (Sync Projects)	✅ Yes	Writes to system tables using impersonated context, especially if external systems are involved
Web Portal / API communication (future)	✅ Yes (strongly)	For SSO/impersonated operations through IIS or API bridges
Transport Packages (migration, deployment)	✅ Yes	When exporting/importing between environments using signed, impersonated objects



---

🛠 Even if Admin User Is Manually Created:

OneIM still:

Uses internal Kerberos calls during compilation, job registration, object mapping, etc.

Fails if:

trwoiomhrt02$ is not trusted for delegation

lab_iga_admin is marked as sensitive

SQL Server is accessed under impersonation but the SPNs or delegation flags aren’t set




---

✅ Recommended Position (You Can Say to Infra Team):

> While I can manually create the database user and skip the schema user script, delegation will still be required at multiple internal stages of One Identity Manager — including Designer, Job Server setup, and Sync Editor operations.

Without these delegation flags, those operations are likely to fail later with similar impersonation or Kerberos-related errors, even after bypassing initial user creation.




---

Let me know if you’d like this explanation included in the request message as a “Justification Note” to ensure they take it seriously.







Great technical question, Divya — this is exactly the kind of insight that distinguishes advanced IAM engineers. Let's break it down clearly.


---

🔍 Why Trusting Only the Computer Is NOT Enough

✅ 1. Trusting the Computer (trwoiomhrt02$)

This allows other services to delegate credentials to this computer — meaning:

Other machines can pass Kerberos tickets to your VM.

Your VM is allowed to receive delegated credentials and act on behalf of users.


✅ This is required, but only half the solution.


---

❌ 2. If the User (lab_iga_admin) Is Not Trusted

Even though the computer is allowed to act on behalf of users, some users are marked as sensitive and not eligible for delegation by default.

If the lab_iga_admin account has:

✅ “Account is sensitive and cannot be delegated” → ❌ Delegation fails.

❌ Even if the computer is trusted, Kerberos refuses to issue a forwardable ticket for such users.



---

🧠 Think of It Like This:

Trust Level	Description	Result

✅ Trusted computer	“I am a machine others can trust to carry their identity.”	Allowed to receive delegation
❌ Non-delegable user	“But I (the user) don’t allow anyone to carry my identity.”	Delegation fails


So the Kerberos ticket granting service (TGS) refuses to issue a forwardable TGT if the user is marked as sensitive, even if the machine is fully trusted.


---

🔐 Security Reason

This is a protection mechanism to prevent someone from impersonating high-privilege or sensitive accounts (like domain admins, service accounts, etc.) via delegation.


---

✅ Final Summary

Setting	Why It’s Required

✅ Trust computer	Allows it to receive and use delegated credentials
✅ Trust user (unset sensitive flag)	Allows their credentials to be delegated
❌ Missing either one	Kerberos delegation will fail



---

💡 TL;DR

> You must enable both:

Trust the computer: to allow it to act on behalf of users

Trust the user: so Kerberos allows their identity to be delegated


Without both, you’ll hit delegation errors even if only one is missing.



Let me know if you'd like this phrased formally for inclusion in your delegation request to the infra team.
