This scheme permits the physical address space of a process to be non-contiguous.</p><h3 class='mt-4'>How Paging Works</h3><p>Paging divides the process's virtual address space into blocks of physical memory called <em>pages</em>. The corresponding blocks of physical memory are called <em>frames</em>. When a process is executed, the pages of the process are loaded into available memory frames from the storage, such as a hard disk.</p><ul class='list-group mb-4'>    <li class='list-group-item'><strong>Page Table:</strong> The operating system maintains a <em>page table</em> for each process, which contains the mapping between the process's virtual pages and the physical frames.</li>    <li class='list-group-item'><strong>Page Number and Offset:</strong> A virtual address is divided into two parts: the <em>page number</em> and the <em>offset</em>. The page number is used to index into the page table to find the corresponding frame number, and the offset is used to locate the exact byte within the frame.</li></ul><h3 class='mt-4'>Advantages of Paging</h3><p>Paging provides several benefits, including:</p><ul class='list-group mb-4'>    <li class='list-group-item'><strong>Elimination of External Fragmentation:</strong> Since pages are of a fixed size, there are no gaps between them, reducing external fragmentation.</li>    <li class='list-group-item'><strong>Efficient Memory Allocation:</strong> It allows for efficient memory allocation and deallocation as it uses fixed-size pages.</li>    <li class='list-group-item'><strong>Security and Isolation:</strong> Each process is isolated from others, enhancing security and stability.</li></ul><h3 class='mt-4'>Disadvantages of Paging</h3><p>Despite its benefits, paging has some disadvantages:</p><ul class='list-group mb-4'>    <li class='list-group-item'><strong>Internal Fragmentation:</strong> Since pages are of a fixed size, there might be some wasted space within each frame, leading to internal fragmentation.</li>    <li class='list-group-item'><strong>Overhead of Maintaining Page Tables:</strong> The operating system needs to maintain page tables for each process, which can consume significant memory and processing power.</li></ul><h3 class='mt-4'>Page Replacement Algorithms</h3><p>When the physical memory is full, and a new page needs to be loaded, the operating system must replace an existing page using a <em>page replacement algorithm</em>. Some common algorithms include:</p><ul class='list-group mb-4'>    <li class='list-group-item'><strong>FIFO (First-In-First-Out):</strong> Replaces the oldest page in memory.</li>    <li class='list-group-item'><strong>LRU (Least Recently Used):</strong> Replaces the page that has not been used for the longest time.</li>    <li class='list-group-item'><strong>Optimal Page Replacement:</strong> Replaces the page that will not be used for the longest time in the future.</li></ul><p>Understanding and implementing efficient paging strategies are crucial for optimizing the performance and stability of an operating system.</p>"
