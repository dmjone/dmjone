Absolutely. Here’s a comprehensive, phase-by-phase, from-scratch blueprint to deploy machine accounts and hand over assets to employees in a BFSI environment—ensuring full accountability, auditability, and compliance at every step.


---

📋 Phase 1: Project Governance & Planning

1. Establish Stakeholders & Roles

Project Sponsor (e.g., CISO)

Project Manager (e.g., You/Divya)

Infrastructure Lead (network & servers)

AD/Identity Lead (Active Directory & OneIM)

Security & Compliance Officer

Service Desk & Asset Team



2. Define Scope & Deliverables

Deliverable 1: Fully operational AD domain + OneIM instance

Deliverable 2: Automated machine-account onboarding workflow

Deliverable 3: Asset-management integration & employee handoff process



3. Change Management & Approvals

Raise a formal Change Request (CR) in ServiceNow

Obtain sign-off from Compliance & InfoSec

Schedule maintenance windows



4. Documentation & Ticketing

Create a Runbook repository (e.g., Confluence)

Template all tasks as tickets (ServiceNow/Remedy) for full audit trail





---

🏗️ Phase 2: Infrastructure & Environment Setup

2.1 Network & Servers

Network

VLANs: Mgmt, DCs, App, User

Firewalls: Allow ports 88, 389, 636, 445, 1433, 8080-8081 between subnets


Servers

DC01, DC02 (Windows Server 2019/2022)

SQL01 (Windows + SQL Server Enterprise)

ONEIM01 (Windows Server for OneIM components)



2.2 DNS & NTP

Configure authoritative DNS on DCs

Point all servers to internal NTP pool for time sync (critical for Kerberos)



---

🖥️ Phase 3: Active Directory Deployment

1. Promote Domain Controllers

Install-WindowsFeature AD-Domain-Services,DNS -IncludeManagementTools
Install-ADDSForest `
  -DomainName corp.bank.local `
  -SafeModeAdministratorPassword (ConvertTo-SecureString P@ssw0rd! -AsPlainText -Force) `
  -InstallDNS


2. OU & Group Structure

OU: corp.bank.local/Computers/Servers/Prod

OU: corp.bank.local/Computers/Workstations

Security Groups: SG_Machine_Admins, SG_Machine_Users, SG_Machine_Dept_<DeptName>



3. GPOs for Machine Accounts

Naming Convention: Enforce via logon script or OneIM rule

Security Baseline: Apply CIS benchmarks for Windows servers



4. Delegation & ACLs

Delegate “Create Computer objects” to Service Account OU-level

Audit “Write” and “Delete” on Computers container





---

🛡️ Phase 4: One Identity Manager (OneIM) Installation

1. Pre-install Checklist

SQL Server instance created with a dedicated DB (OneIM_DB)

Service accounts:

svc_OneIM_SQL with db_owner on OneIM_DB

svc_OneIM_Service as local admin on ONEIM01




2. Install Designer & Components

Mount OneIM ISO on ONEIM01

Launch Setup → choose Designer, Sync Editor, Data Importer, Manager

Point to OneIM_DB, specify service accounts

Activate license key



3. Secure Service Communication

Generate TLS cert for oneim.corp.bank.local

Bind to IIS sites for Manager & Data Importer

Enforce HTTPS only





---

🔌 Phase 5: Connector & Sync Configuration

1. Active Directory Connector

In Sync Editor, create connector:

Type: LDAP/AD

Bind DN: svc_OneIM_Sync@corp.bank.local

Base DN: OU=Servers,DC=corp,DC=bank,DC=local




2. Define Object Mappings

Map UNSAccountB → distinguishedName

Map HostName → sAMAccountName$

Add custom attribute AssetTag



3. CSV Import Connector (for bulk asset import)

Template CSV:

HostName,AssetTag,SerialNumber,Owner,Dept,PurchaseDate,WarrantyExpiry
SQL-PROD-BANK01,ASSET-1001,SN12345,John.Smith,DBA,2025-01-15,2028-01-14

Configure Data Importer to run nightly, “Create missing UNSAccountB entries”





---

⚙️ Phase 6: Machine-Account Onboarding Workflow

1. Ticket-driven Onboarding

Employee requests new server/VM via ServiceNow

Ticket contains asset details + intended owner



2. Approval Gate

Manager & InfoSec must approve → ticket updated to “Approved”



3. Automated Provisioning Script

param($HostName,$OU,$DomainCred)
New-ADComputer -Name $HostName -Path $OU -Credential $DomainCred

Triggered by OneIM workflow after CSV import



4. Domain Join & Configuration

Once VM spins up, run:

Add-Computer -DomainName corp.bank.local `
  -Credential (Get-Credential svc_OneIM_Svc) -Restart

Machine pulls GPOs, inventory agent installs



5. Asset Tag Labeling

Physical label affixed; barcode scanned back into CMDB → updates OneIM asset attribute





---

🎁 Phase 7: Employee Handoff & Accountability

1. Generate Asset Handoff Form

Pre-populate: HostName, AssetTag, SerialNumber, OS, Owner, Dept

Require digital signature (ServiceNow form or e-signature tool)



2. Delivery & Training

Ops team hands asset to employee against signed form

Log in ServiceNow: Ticket “Provisioned” + attach signed form



3. Audit Trail

All actions (AD creation, domain join, CSV import) logged in OneIM audit logs

ServiceNow ticket history retains timestamps, approvers, attachments





---

🔍 Phase 8: Monitoring, Reviews & Compliance

1. Daily Sync Health Check

OneIM → Sync Editor logs → send email alert if sync fails



2. SIEM Integration

Forward OneIM audit events + Windows Security logs → Splunk/QRadar

Correlate machine-account creations, deletions, and domain-join anomalies



3. Periodic Access Certification

Quarterly review: Security Officer reviews all machine-accounts in scope

Use OneIM Manager → “Certification Campaign” → notify owners



4. Compliance Reporting

Generate report: “All machine accounts created last quarter”

Include ticket IDs, approval timestamps, and asset-tag details





---

🗑️ Phase 9: Decommissioning & Offboarding

1. Retirement Request

Employee/Manager raises ticket to retire VM/asset



2. Grace Period & Data Archival

Archive logs & data for 90 days (per BFSI retention policy)



3. Disable & Delete

OneIM workflow:

Disable-ADComputer –Identity <HostName>

After 30 days, Remove-ADComputer –Identity <HostName>


Update CMDB to “Retired” + attach final audit record



4. Physical Disposal

Wipe device per NIST 800-88 → mark asset “Disposed” in CMDB





---

📑 Phase 10: Documentation & Handover

Finalize Runbooks for each step (with screenshots & commands)

Training Session for Ops & Service Desk

Handover Meeting: Review workflows, SLAs, and emergency playbooks



---

This end-to-end process ensures full accountability, audit readiness, and seamless experience for both IT and end users—critical in the BFSI domain. Let me know if you need any of the specific scripts, runbook templates, or configuration snapshots.
