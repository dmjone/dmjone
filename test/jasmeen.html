            <h3>1.1 Introduction to Logic</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>What is Logic?</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Definition: Logic is the study of reasoning, including the principles and criteria of valid inference and demonstration.</li>
                    <li>Importance: It forms the basis of rational thinking and problem-solving in various fields.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Real-World Applications</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Everyday decision-making</li>
                    <li>Computer programming</li>
                    <li>Mathematics</li>
                    <li>Critical thinking</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <h3>1.2 Basic Concepts of Logic</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Statements</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Definition: A statement is a sentence that is either true or false.</li>
                    <li>Examples: "The sky is blue." (True), "2 + 2 = 5." (False)</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Truth Values</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Explanation: Every statement has a truth value: True (T) or False (F).</li>
                    <li>Importance: Understanding truth values is crucial for logical reasoning.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <h3>1.3 Logical Operators</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>AND (Conjunction)</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Definition: The result is true if both statements are true.</li>
                    <li>Example: "It is raining AND it is cold."</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>OR (Disjunction)</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Definition: The result is true if at least one statement is true.</li>
                    <li>Example: "It is raining OR it is cold."</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>NOT (Negation)</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Definition: Inverts the truth value of a statement.</li>
                    <li>Example: "NOT raining" means it is not raining.</li>
                </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Puzzle 1: Truth Tellers and Liars</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Scenario: You meet two people. One always tells the truth, and the other always lies. You can ask one question to find out who is who. What do you ask?</li>
                    <li>Discussion: Encourage participants to think critically and discuss their reasoning.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Puzzle 2: The Two Doors</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Scenario: There are two doors, one leads to freedom, and the other to death. There are two guards, one always tells the truth, and the other always lies. You can ask one question to one guard. What do you ask to choose the door to freedom?</li>
                    <li>Discussion: Facilitate group discussion and reasoning.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <h3>2.2 Logical Statements Practice</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Activity: Identify Truth Values</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Provide a list of statements and ask participants to determine their truth values.</li>
                    <li>Examples:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>"The Earth orbits the Sun." (True)</li>
                        <li>"Water boils at 50 degrees Celsius." (False)</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Activity: Combine Statements with Logical Operators</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Provide pairs of statements and ask participants to combine them using AND, OR, and NOT.</li>
                    <li>Examples:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>"The sky is blue" AND "Grass is green."</li>
                        <li>"It is raining" OR "It is snowing."</li>
                        <li>"NOT (2 + 2 = 5)"</li>
