                <h3>1. Introduction to Databases</h3>
                <p>Databases are essential tools for managing and organizing data. They serve as structured collections of data that are designed to be easily accessed, managed, and updated. In any organization, databases play a pivotal role in storing information related to operations, transactions, and analytics. The organization of data into databases facilitates efficient data retrieval, manipulation, and management through various database management systems (DBMS).</p>
                <ul class="list-unstyled">
                    <li><strong>Entities, Attributes, and Relationships:</strong> Fundamental components that represent real-world objects, their properties, and the connections between them.</li>
                    <li><strong>System Catalog (Metadata):</strong> Provides a detailed description of all data within the database, enhancing data accessibility and manipulation.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>1.1 System Catalog (Metadata)</h4>
                <p>The system catalog, or metadata, is an integral part of a database, offering a comprehensive description of data, including tables, columns, data types, and relationships. This detailed information aids in achieving program-data independence, which allows applications to access data without needing to know the details of how data is stored or structured. The system catalog is crucial for database management, ensuring consistent data description and facilitating data access across various applications.</p>
                <ul class="list-unstyled">
                    <li><strong>Role in Data Independence:</strong> Facilitates abstraction between the data and the programs that use the data.</li>
                    <li><strong>Enhanced Data Accessibility:</strong> Metadata allows for more efficient data search and retrieval operations.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>1.2 Entities, Attributes, and Relationships</h4>
                <p>In the context of databases, entities represent real-world objects or concepts, attributes detail the properties or characteristics of these entities, and relationships describe how entities relate to one another. Understanding these components is vital for effective database design and operation, as they form the foundational structure upon which databases are built.</p>
                <ul class="list-unstyled">
                    <li><strong>Entities:</strong> Can be tangible (like an employee or product) or intangible (such as an event or concept).</li>
                    <li><strong>Attributes:</strong> Provide more details about entities, such as an employee's name or a product's price.</li>
                    <li><strong>Relationships:</strong> Define how entities interact with each other, establishing connections that reflect real-world interactions.</li>

                <h3>3. Database Approach</h3>
                <p>The database approach to managing data represents a significant shift from traditional file-based systems, emphasizing structured data storage, access, and manipulation. This approach allows for the centralized management of data, improving data consistency, integrity, and security. Through the use of Data Definition Language (DDL) and Data Manipulation Language (DML), databases provide a flexible and efficient way to define data structures and perform various data operations.</p>
                <ul class="list-unstyled">
                    <li><strong>Data Definition Language (DDL):</strong> Used for specifying database schemas, creating, and altering database objects.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Manipulation Language (DML):</strong> Enables data retrieval, insertion, deletion, and updating within the database.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>3.1 Data Definition Language (DDL)</h4>
                <p>DDL is a set of SQL commands used to define the database structure. It includes commands for creating, altering, and deleting database objects such as tables, indexes, and views. DDL is instrumental in laying out the database schema, ensuring that data conforms to specified structures and constraints.</p>
                <ul class="list-unstyled">
                    <li><strong>CREATE, ALTER, DROP:</strong> Primary DDL commands for managing database objects.</li>

                <h3>8. History of Database Systems</h3>
                <p>The historical evolution of database systems showcases the technological advancements and conceptual shifts that have shaped data storage, access, and management over the decades. This progression from hierarchical and network models to relational and subsequently object-oriented and object-relational models reflects the industry's response to the growing complexity of data and user needs.</p>
                <ul class="list-unstyled">
                    <li><strong>First-Generation:</strong> The hierarchical and network models dominated early database systems, offering a structured approach to data management. Hierarchical models organized data in a tree-like structure, facilitating efficient data retrieval but limiting flexibility. Network models introduced more complex relationships by allowing multiple parent-child linkages, offering greater flexibility at the cost of increased complexity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Second-Generation:</strong> Marked by the advent of the relational model, introduced by E.F. Codd in 1970. This model revolutionized database management by using a table-based structure, simplifying data manipulation and querying through SQL. The relational model's emphasis on data independence and its ability to handle ad-hoc queries made it the foundation for modern database systems.</li>
                    <li><strong>Third-Generation:</strong> The development of object-oriented and object-relational models addressed the need to manage more complex data types, such as multimedia and custom data structures. Object-oriented databases integrate the database with object-oriented programming concepts, allowing for more complex data structures and relationships. Object-relational databases combine elements of the relational model with object-oriented features, providing flexibility in handling complex data while maintaining compatibility with relational databases.</li>
