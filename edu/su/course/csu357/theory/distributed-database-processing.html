            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>3.6 Local Autonomy</h4>
                <p>Local sites in a distributed system can operate semi-independently, which is particularly beneficial for organizations with branch offices that need to tailor database operations to local requirements without impacting other nodes.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>3.7 Economical</h4>
                <p>Utilizing existing servers and infrastructure to host different nodes of a distributed database can be more economical than maintaining a single, large centralized system. This can lead to significant savings in both operational and capital expenditures.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>3.8 Reduced Data Redundancy</h4>
                <p>While DDS often involves data replication for reliability, it can be designed to minimize unnecessary redundancy, which optimizes storage utilization and data consistency across nodes.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>3.9 Security</h4>
                <p>By distributing data across multiple locations, DDS can enhance security. Compromising one part of the system does not necessarily endanger data stored in other parts. Additionally, localized data handling can comply with regional data protection regulations.</p>

                    <h4>5.3 Mechanisms</h4>
                    <p>To achieve replication transparency, distributed databases use several mechanisms:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Update Propagation:</strong> Changes made at one site are automatically propagated to all replicas to keep them synchronized.</li>
                        <li><strong>Conflict Resolution:</strong> In case of simultaneous updates to the same data at different sites, the system employs strategies like timestamp ordering or voting to resolve conflicts.</li>
                        <li><strong>Consistency Levels:</strong> Systems may offer different levels of consistency from eventual to strict consistency, balancing between performance and accuracy based on application needs.</li>
                    </ul>

                <h3>6. Fragmentation Transparency</h3>
                <p>Fragmentation transparency is a critical feature in distributed database systems, allowing the system to divide data across multiple locations without users being aware of these divisions. This type of transparency simplifies user queries and application development by making the distribution of data seem invisible.</p>

                <article>
                    <h4>6.1 Definition</h4>
                    <p>Fragmentation transparency ensures that users and applications do not need to consider how data is fragmented or distributed across different sites. Whether data is split horizontally (rows) or vertically (columns), the system handles complexities related to data location and access.</p>

                    <h4>6.2 Benefits</h4>
                    <p>Key benefits of fragmentation transparency include enhanced performance and improved data locality. By strategically placing data closer to where it is frequently accessed, the system reduces query response times and network load.</p>

                    <h4>6.3 Types of Fragmentation</h4>
                    <p>There are primarily two types of data fragmentation in distributed systems:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Horizontal Fragmentation:</strong> Data is divided into rows, each fragment containing a subset of the total rows based on specific criteria, often related to geographic or organizational structures.</li>
                        <li><strong>Vertical Fragmentation:</strong> Data is divided into columns, with each fragment holding a subset of the total columns. This is useful for applications that frequently access specific fields of data.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>6.4 Managing Fragmentation</h4>
                    <p>To manage data efficiently, the system employs algorithms to determine the optimal way to fragment data based on access patterns and query frequency. This dynamic approach ensures that fragmentation strategies evolve as access patterns change, maintaining optimal system performance.</p>
