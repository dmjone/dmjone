        <h3>1. Introduction to Graph Theory</h3>
        <p>Graph Theory is a fundamental area of study in mathematics and computer science, focusing on the analysis of graphs. A graph is a structure comprising nodes (or vertices) connected by edges (or arcs). Graphs are used to model various real-world phenomena, including networks, relationships, and physical structures.</p>

      <article id="basic-terminologies">
        <h4>1.1 Basic Terminologies</h4>
        <p>Before delving into the depths of graph theory, it is essential to understand the basic terminologies:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Vertex:</strong> A node in a graph.</li>
          <li><strong>Edge:</strong> A connection between two vertices.</li>
          <li><strong>Adjacency:</strong> Two vertices are adjacent if they are connected by an edge.</li>
          <li><strong>Path:</strong> A sequence of vertices where each adjacent pair is connected by an edge.</li>
        </ul>
      </article>

      <article id="fundamentals-of-graph-theory">
        <h4>1.1.1 Fundamentals of Graph Theory</h4>
        <p>At the core of Graph Theory lies the graph, a mathematical structure that models pairwise relations between objects. A graph is made up of vertices (or nodes) and edges (or links). There are various types of graphs, such as directed, undirected, weighted, and unweighted graphs.</p>
        <p>$$G = (V, E)$$</p>
        <p>Where $G$ is a graph consisting of a set of vertices $V$ and a set of edges $E$.</p>

      <article id="types-of-graphs">
        <h4>1.2 Types of Graphs</h4>
        <p>There are several types of graphs, each with its own set of properties and applications.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Undirected Graph:</strong> A graph where edges have no direction.</li>
          <li><strong>Directed Graph (Digraph):</strong> A graph where edges have directions.</li>
          <li><strong>Weighted Graph:</strong> A graph where edges have weights or values associated with them.</li>
          <li><strong>Bipartite Graph:</strong> A graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets such that every edge connects a vertex in one set to a vertex in the other set.</li>

      <article id="graph-representations">
        <h4>1.3 Graph Representations</h4>
        <p>Graphs can be represented in various forms such as adjacency matrix, adjacency list, and incidence matrix. Each representation has its own advantages and is used based on the requirements of the problem. There are two common ways to represent a graph in computer memory:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Adjacency Matrix:</strong> A 2D array of size V x V where V is the number of vertices in the graph. The value matrix[i][j] is 1 if there is an edge from vertex i to vertex j, otherwise 0.
            <p>$Adjacency\ Matrix: G[i][j] = 1$ if there is an edge between vertex i and vertex j, else 0.</p>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Adjacency List:</strong> An array of lists. The size of the array is equal to the number of vertices. An entry array[i] represents the list of vertices adjacent to the ith vertex.
            <p>$Adjacency\ List: G[i]$ is a list of vertices that are adjacent to vertex i.</p>
          </li>

      <article id="graph-traversal">
        <h4>1.4 Graph Traversal</h4>
        <p>Graph traversal is the process of visiting all the vertices of a graph. There are two standard graph traversal algorithms:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Depth-First Search (DFS):</strong> DFS is a graph traversal method that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
            <pre><code class="language-cpp">
void dfs(int v, vector&lt;bool&gt; &visited, vector&lt;vector&lt;int&gt;&gt; &graph) {

            dfs(u, visited, graph);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Breadth-First Search (BFS):</strong> BFS is a graph traversal method that explores all the vertices at the present "depth" before moving on to vertices at the next depth level.
            <pre><code class="language-cpp">void bfs(int v, vector&lt;vector&lt;int&gt;&gt; &graph) {

        <p>Graph Theory and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) may seem like two different domains, but they can be intertwined elegantly. In OOP, objects are instances of classes and can be thought of as vertices in a graph. The relationships between these objects, such as inheritance and association, can be considered as edges. This analogy helps in visualizing complex object-oriented systems as graphs, which can be analyzed for design patterns and optimizations.</p>
