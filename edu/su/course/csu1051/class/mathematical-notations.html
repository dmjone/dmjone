        <h3>2. Basic Mathematical Notation</h3>
        <p>In this section, we will cover basic mathematical notation often used in data structures and algorithms, such as sets, sequences, and summations.</p>
        <h4>2.1 Sets</h4>
        <p>A set is an unordered collection of distinct elements. It is typically denoted by using curly brackets. For example, the set containing elements 1, 2, and 3 can be written as:</p>
        <p>$$S = \{1, 2, 3\}$$</p>
        <p>The size (cardinality) of the set is denoted by $|S|$. In the example above, $|S| = 3$. Some common set operations include union ($\cup$), intersection ($\cap$), and difference ($-$).</p>
        <h4>2.2 Sequences</h4>
        <p>A sequence is an ordered list of elements. A sequence can be denoted using angle brackets, as shown:</p>
        <p>$$A = \langle a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots, a_n \rangle$$</p>
        <p>The length of a sequence is the number of elements in it, denoted by $|A|$. In the example above, $|A| = n$. A sequence may also be represented as a function, where the domain is a set of integers, and the range is a set of elements.</p>
        <h4>2.3 Summations</h4>
        <p>Summations are used to express the sum of a series of terms. The most common notation for a summation is the Greek capital letter sigma ($\Sigma$). The general form of a summation is:</p>
        <p>$$\sum_{i=a}^{b} f(i)$$</p>
        <p>where $a$ and $b$ are the lower and upper limits of the summation, respectively, and $f(i)$ is the function defining the terms to be summed.</p>

        <h3>3. Asymptotic Notation and Complexity Analysis</h3>
        <p>Asymptotic notation is used to describe the growth of functions, which is crucial in analyzing the performance of algorithms. It provides a way to express the upper and lower bounds of a function's growth. The most common notations are Big O, Big Omega, and Big Theta.</p>
        <h4>3.1 Big O Notation</h4>
        <p>Big O notation ($O$) is used to express an upper bound on the growth of a function. It provides an asymptotic upper bound for the growth of a function. If $f(n)$ is a function, and there exists a constant $c > 0$ and an integer $n_0 \geq 1$ such that $0 \leq f(n) \leq c \cdot g(n)$ for all $n \geq n_0$, then we can write:</p>
        <p>$$f(n) = O(g(n))$$</p>

        <p>For example, if the running time of an algorithm is $f(n) = 3n^2 + 2n + 1$, we can say that $f(n) = O(n^2)$, since the dominant term is $n^2$.</p>
        <h4>3.2 Big Omega Notation</h4>
        <p>Big Omega notation ($\Omega$) is used to express a lower bound on the growth of a function. It provides an asymptotic lower bound for the growth of a function. If $f(n)$ is a function, and there exists a constant $c > 0$ and an integer $n_0 \geq 1$ such that $0 \leq c \cdot g(n) \leq f(n)$ for all $n \geq n_0$, then we can write:</p>
        <p>$$f(n) = \Omega(g(n))$$</p>
        <p>For example, if the running time of an algorithm is $f(n) = 3n^2 + 2n + 1$, we can say that $f(n) = \Omega(n^2)$, since the dominant term is $n^2$.</p>
        <h4>3.3 Big Theta Notation</h4>
        <p>Big Theta notation ($\Theta$) is used to express a tight bound on the growth of a function. If a function $f(n)$ is both $O(g(n))$ and $\Omega(g(n))$, then it is also $\Theta(g(n))$. This means that there exist constants $c_1, c_2 > 0$ and an integer $n_0 \geq 1$ such that $0 \leq c_1 \cdot g(n) \leq f(n) \leq c_2 \cdot g(n)$ for all $n \geq n_0$. In other words:</p>
        <p>$$f(n) = \Theta(g(n))$$</p>
        <p>For example, if the running time of an algorithm is $f(n) = 3n^2 + 2n + 1$, we can say that $f(n) = \Theta(n^2)$, since the dominant term is $n^2$.</p>

        <h3>4. Recurrence Relations and Solving Techniques</h3>
        <p>Recurrence relations describe a sequence of values by defining each term in the sequence based on previous terms. These relations are frequently encountered when analyzing the performance of recursive algorithms.</p>
        <h4>4.1 Recurrence Relations</h4>
        <p>A recurrence relation is an equation that defines a sequence recursively, based on previous terms. The simplest example of a recurrence relation is the Fibonacci sequence, defined as follows:</p>
        <p>$$F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)$$</p>
        <p>with initial conditions $F(0) = 0$ and $F(1) = 1$.</p>
        <h4>4.2 Solving Techniques</h4>
        <p>There are several methods for solving recurrence relations, such as substitution, iteration, the Master theorem, and generating functions. We will briefly discuss these methods below.</p>
        <h5>4.2.1 Substitution</h5>
        <p>Substitution is the process of repeatedly substituting the recurrence relation into itself until a pattern is found. This method can be used to find a closed-form solution for the recurrence relation.</p>
        <h5>4.2.2 Iteration</h5>
        <p>Iteration involves expanding the recurrence relation to obtain an iterative formula. This method can be used to approximate the solution of the recurrence relation or obtain a closed-form solution in some cases.</p>
        <h5>4.2.3 Master Theorem</h5>
        <p>The Master theorem is a technique used to solve recurrence relations of the form:</p>
        <p>$$T(n) = aT\left(\frac{n}{b}\right) + f(n)$$</p>
        <p>where $a \geq 1$, $b > 1$, and $f(n)$ is an asymptotically positive function. The Master theorem provides a closed-form solution for the recurrence relation, depending on the relative growth rates of $f(n)$ and $n^{\log_b{a}}$.</p>
        <h5>4.2.4 Generating Functions</h5>
        <p>Generating functions are a powerful method for solving recurrence relations by transforming them into algebraic equations. A generating function is a formal power series of the form:</p>
        <p>$$G(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_nx^n$$</p>
        <p>where $a_n$ is the $n$-th term of the sequence. Generating functions can be used to manipulate recurrence relations and find closed-form solutions for the corresponding sequences.</p>

        <h3>5. Advanced Topics in Data Structures and Algorithms</h3>
        <p>In this section, we will discuss advanced topics in data structures and algorithms, such as amortized analysis, randomized algorithms, and parallel algorithms.</p>
        <h4>5.1 Amortized Analysis</h4>
        <p>Amortized analysis is a technique used to analyze the average performance of an algorithm or data structure over a sequence of operations, rather than the worst-case performance of a single operation. This method can provide a more accurate representation of the algorithm's performance in practice. Common techniques for amortized analysis include aggregate analysis, the accounting method, and the potential method.</p>
        <h4>5.2 Randomized Algorithms</h4>
        <p>Randomized algorithms are algorithms that make random choices during their execution. These algorithms can often achieve better average-case performance than deterministic algorithms. Examples of randomized algorithms include randomized quicksort, the Monte Carlo method, and the Las Vegas algorithm.</p>
        <h4>5.3 Parallel Algorithms</h4>
        <p>Parallel algorithms are designed to exploit parallelism in hardware or software to solve problems more efficiently. These algorithms can be executed concurrently on multiple processors or cores, providing significant speedup compared to sequential algorithms. Examples of parallel algorithms include parallel prefix sum, parallel merge sort, and parallel matrix multiplication.</p>
