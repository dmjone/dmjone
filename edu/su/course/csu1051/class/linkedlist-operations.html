        <h3>1. Introduction: Linked Lists - The Cornerstone of Dynamic Data Structures</h3>
        <p>Imagine you're building a dynamic data structure, needing to accommodate an unpredictable number of elements with frequent additions and deletions. One efficient way to solve this problem is by utilizing a linked list. A linked list is a linear data structure comprising nodes, where each node contains a data element and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence. This structure allows for efficient insertions and deletions at any position in the sequence.</p>
        <p>In comparison to arrays, linked lists offer the advantage of efficient insertions and deletions without the need for shifting elements, making them ideal for certain scenarios. However, they lack direct access to individual elements and can consume more memory due to the storage required for links.</p>
      </article>

      <article id="linked-list-types">
        <h3>2. Types of Linked Lists</h3>
        <p>Linked lists can take different forms based on how nodes are linked together:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Singly Linked List:</b> Each node holds data and a link to the next node, forming a linear sequence of nodes.</li>
          <li><b>Doubly Linked List:</b> Nodes hold data and two links, pointing to the previous and next nodes, allowing traversal in both directions.</li>
          <li><b>Circular Linked List:</b> The last node in the list points back to the first node, creating a circular loop.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Our focus will be primarily on singly linked lists for simplicity, although the principles discussed apply to all types with minor adjustments.</p>

        <h3>3. Operations on Linked Lists</h3>
        <p>Three fundamental operations on linked lists we will examine in detail are: Insertion, Deletion, and Traversal.</p>
      </article>

      <article id="insertion-operation">
        <h4>3.1 Insertion Operation</h4>
        <p>The insertion operation adds a new node to the list. Depending on the position where the node is inserted, it can be categorized into three types:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Insertion at the beginning:</b> A new node is added before the current head node, becoming the new head.</li>
          <li><b>Insertion at the end:</b> A new node is added after the last node, becoming the new tail.</li>
          <li><b>Insertion at a given position:</b> A new node is inserted at a specific position, shifting the subsequent nodes.</li>
        </ul>
      </article>

      <article id="insertion-beginning">
        <h5>3.1.1 Insertion at the Beginning</h5>
        <p>

          Inserting a new node at the beginning involves creating a new node, setting its link to point to the current head, and updating the head to the new node. This operation is generally constant time O(1), irrespective of the list's size.</p>
        <pre><code class="language-cpp">// CPP program to insert a new node at the beginning of a Singly Linked List
#include &lt;bits/stdc++.h&gt;
using namespace std;

class Node {
public:
   int data;
   Node* next;
};

void push(Node** head_ref, int new_data) {
    Node* new_node = new Node();
    new_node->data = new_data;
    new_node->next = (*head_ref);
    (*head_ref) = new_node;
}
</code></pre>
      </article>

      <article id="insertion-end">
        <h5>3.1.2 Insertion at the End</h5>
        <p>For inserting at the end, the new node should be linked to the last node in the list. This operation involves traversing the entire list, resulting in a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list.</p>
        <pre><code class="language-cpp">// CPP program to insert a new node at the end of a Singly Linked List

    new_node->next = NULL;
    if (*head_ref == NULL) {
       *head_ref = new_node;

    }

    while (last->next) {
       last = last->next;
    }
    last->next = new_node;
}
</code></pre>
      </article>

      <article id="insertion-position">
        <h5>3.1.3 Insertion at a Given Position</h5>
        <p>Inserting a node at a given position requires traversing the list to the desired position and adjusting the links accordingly. The new node points to the node previously at this position, and the preceding node now points to the new node. This operation has a time complexity of O(k) where k is the position where the new node will be inserted.</p>
        <pre><code class="language-cpp">// CPP program to insert a new node at a specific position in a Singly Linked List
#include &lt;bits/stdc++.h&gt;

void insertAfter(Node* prev_node, int new_data) {
    if (prev_node == NULL) {
       cout &lt;&lt; "The given previous node cannot be NULL";
       return;

    new_node->next = prev_node->next;
    prev_node->next = new_node;
}
</code></pre>
      </article>

      <article id="deletion-operation">
        <h4>3.2 Deletion Operation</h4>
        <p>The deletion operation removes a node from the linked list. It requires the position or key of the node to be deleted. This operation includes two tasks: locating the node to be deleted and changing the 'next' link of the preceding node. If the head node is deleted, it should be updated to the second node in the list. The deletion operation has a time complexity of O(n) because it might need to traverse the entire list.</p>
        <pre><code class="language-cpp">// CPP program to delete

 a node from a Singly Linked List
#include &lt;bits/stdc++.h&gt;
using namespace std;

class Node {
public:
   int data;
   Node* next;

    Node* temp = *head_ref;
    Node* prev = NULL;

    if (temp != NULL && temp->data == key) {
       *head_ref = temp->next;
       delete temp;
       return;
    }

    while (temp != NULL && temp->data != key) {
       prev = temp;
       temp = temp->next;

    if (temp == NULL)
       return;

    prev->next = temp->next;
    delete temp;
}
</code></pre>
      </article>

      <article id="traversal-operation">
        <h4>3.3 Traversal Operation</h4>
        <p>The traversal operation visits each node in the linked list. This operation is commonly used to perform actions on each node, such as printing data. The time complexity of this operation is O(n), as it visits each node exactly once.</p>
        <pre><code class="language-cpp">// CPP program to traverse a Singly Linked List
#include &lt;bits/stdc++.h&gt;
using namespace std;

class Node {
public:

    while (node != NULL) {
       cout << node->data << " ";
       node = node->next;
