        <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
        <p>Imagine a train with a multitude of carriages, each connecting to the next and the previous one, and a circular track that allows the train to go around infinitely without end or beginning. This article is a deep dive into the world of doubly linked lists and circularly linked lists - data structures that mirror this train analogy.

          From their essential structures, technical advantages, and intricate manipulations, to the application in computer science problems, we will explore them all. Key takeaways will be understanding their operational complexity, designing algorithms for their manipulation, and visualizing their workings for improved comprehension. This discussion will touch both on the theoretical underpinnings and practical implementation in C++.

          Remember, as we delve into these structures, they are tools to solve a myriad of problems, not just abstract concepts. Read on to explore a domain where computing science artistry meets intellectual challenge and innovative solutions.

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Imagine you have a multitude of connected nodes, each holding critical data. A one-way street would limit your navigation, demanding that you traverse from the first to the last, even if the required node is closer from the end. That's where doubly linked lists come in, providing a two-way street for seamless and efficient navigation.

          The extension to this - circularly linked lists, add another dimension, allowing an infinite loop through the list and omitting the need to track the start or the end. </p>

        <h3>1. Doubly Linked Lists</h3>
        <p>A Doubly Linked List (DLL) is a complex type of linked list which consists of a set of sequentially linked records called nodes. Each node contains three fields: two link fields (references to the previous and to the next node in the sequence of nodes) and one data field. The starting and ending node's previous and next link is null, respectively.</p>

      <article id="dll-properties">
        <h4>1.1 Properties</h4>
        <p>Some key properties of a DLL include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Each node points to both the next node and the previous node, providing two-way navigation.</li>
          <li>The first node's (head) previous link and the last node's (tail) next link are null, signifying the end of the list.</li>
          <li>It allows for efficient insertion and deletion of nodes from both ends.</li>
          <li>Traversal can occur from both the head or the tail, facilitating reverse navigation.</li>

        <h4>1.3 Operations</h4>
        <p>A number of common operations can be performed on DLLs, including search, insert, delete, reverse, and traverse. Each of these operations has its own time complexity and use case. Let's discuss

          the insertion and deletion operations.</p>

        <h5>1.3.1 Insertion</h5>
        <p>The insertion operation in a DLL involves adding a new node to the list. It can occur in four scenarios:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Insertion at the front</li>
          <li>Insertion at the end</li>
          <li>Insertion after a given node</li>

        <h5>1.3.2 Deletion</h5>

          <li>The first node points to the last node in a doubly circular linked list, forming a two-way navigation cycle.</li>
          <li>Any point in the list can be a starting point, as it cycles infinitely.</li>
