        <h3>1. Introduction to Parallel Algorithms in Data Structures</h3>
        <p>Parallel algorithms are an essential aspect of modern computing, as they enable multiple processors to work on a problem simultaneously, thereby speeding up the execution of tasks. In the context of data structures and algorithms, parallelism is particularly important, as it can lead to significant improvements in the efficiency of various operations, such as searching, sorting, and graph traversal. This article aims to provide a comprehensive overview of parallel algorithms in data structures, starting from basic concepts and gradually progressing to advanced topics suitable for computer science students.</p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h3>2. Data Structures in Parallel Algorithms</h3>
        <p>In this section, we will discuss various data structures that are commonly used in parallel algorithms. These include stacks, queues, and different types of linked lists.</p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h4>2.1 Stacks and Queues Representations</h4>
        <p>A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, where elements are added and removed from the same end, called the "top." A queue, on the other hand, is a linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, where elements are added at one end, called the "rear," and removed from the opposite end, called the "front."</p>
        <p>A stack is a linear data structure that stores elements in a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) manner. This means that the last element that is added to the stack will be the first one to be removed. The operations that are supported by a stack include push, pop, and top. Push is used to add elements to the top of the stack, pop is used to remove elements from the top of the stack, and top is used to retrieve the top element of the stack without removing it.</p>
        <p>Here is an implementation of a stack using an array in C++:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-cpp">#define MAX_SIZE 100

class Stack {
private:
  int arr[MAX_SIZE];
  int top;

public:
  Stack() {
    top = -1;
  }

  void push(int x) {
    if (top == MAX_SIZE - 1) {
      cout << "Error: stack overflow" << endl;
      return;
    }
    arr[++top] = x;
  }

  void pop() {
    if (top == -1) {
      cout << "Error: stack underflow" << endl;
      return;
    }
    top--;
  }

  int Top() {
    if (top == -1) {
      cout << "Error: stack is empty" << endl;
      return -1;
    }
    return arr[top];
  }

  bool isEmpty() {
    return top == -1;
  }
};</code></pre>
        <p>A queue, on the other hand, is a linear data structure that stores elements in a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) manner. This means that the first element that is added to the queue will be the first one to be removed. The operations that are supported by a queue include enqueue, dequeue, and front. Enqueue is used to add elements to the rear of the queue, dequeue is used to remove elements from the front of the queue, and front is used to retrieve the front element of the queue without removing it.</p>
        <p>Here is an implementation of a queue using an array in C++:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-cpp">#define MAX_SIZE 100

class Queue {
private:
  int arr[MAX_SIZE];
  int front, rear;

public:
  Queue() {
    front = -1;
    rear = -1;
  }

  void enqueue(int x) {
    if (rear == MAX_SIZE - 1) {
      cout << "Error: queue overflow" << endl;
      return;
    }
    if (front == -1) {
      front = 0;
    }
    arr[++rear] = x;
  }

  void dequeue() {
    if (front == -1 || front > rear) {
      cout << "Error: queue underflow" << endl;
      return;
    }
    front++;
  }

  int Front() {
    if (front == -1 || front > rear) {
      cout << "Error: queue is empty" << endl;
      return -1;
    }
    return arr[front];
  }

  bool isEmpty() {
    return (front == -1 || front > rear);
  }
};</code></pre>
        <p>In addition to arrays, stacks and queues can also be implemented using linked lists. In a linked list implementation, each element of the stack or queue is represented by a node, which contains a value and a pointer to the next node in the list.</p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h5>2.1.1 Array Representation</h5>
        <p>Both stacks and queues can be represented using arrays. For a stack, we maintain a pointer to the top element, which is incremented or decremented as elements are added or removed. For a queue, we maintain two pointers: one to the front element and one to the rear element. These pointers are updated as elements are added or removed.</p>
        <p>The array representation of a stack involves storing the elements in a contiguous block of memory, with a pointer to the top element. Initially, the top pointer is set to -1, indicating an empty stack. As elements are pushed onto the stack, the top pointer is incremented to point to the new top element. Similarly, as elements are popped from the stack, the top pointer is decremented to point to the new top element.</p>
        <p>Here is an example of a stack implemented using an array in C++:</p>

        <pre><code class="language-cpp">#define MAX_SIZE 100

class Stack {
private:
  int arr[MAX_SIZE];
  int top;

public:
  Stack() {
    top = -1;
  }

  void push(int x) {
    if (top == MAX_SIZE - 1) {
      cout << "Error: stack overflow" << endl;
      return;
    }
    arr[++top] = x;
  }

  void pop() {
    if (top == -1) {
      cout << "Error: stack underflow" << endl;
      return;
    }
    top--;
  }

  int Top() {
    if (top == -1) {
      cout << "Error: stack is empty" << endl;
      return -1;
    }
    return arr[top];
  }

  bool isEmpty() {
    return top == -1;
  }
};</code></pre>
        <p>The array representation of a queue also involves storing the elements in a contiguous block of memory. However, unlike a stack, we need to keep track of both the front and rear of the queue. Initially, both pointers are set to -1, indicating an empty queue. As elements are enqueued, the rear pointer is incremented to point to the new rear element. Similarly, as elements are dequeued, the front pointer is incremented to point to the new front element.</p>
        <p>Here is an example of a queue implemented using an array in C++:</p>

        <pre><code class="language-cpp">#define MAX_SIZE 100

class Queue {
private:
  int arr[MAX_SIZE];
  int front, rear;

public:
  Queue() {
    front = -1;
    rear = -1;
  }

  void enqueue(int x) {
    if (rear == MAX_SIZE - 1) {
      cout << "Error: queue overflow" << endl;
      return;
    }
    if (front == -1) {
      front = 0;
    }
    arr[++rear] = x;
  }

  void dequeue() {
    if (front == -1 || front > rear) {
      cout << "Error: queue underflow" << endl;
      return;
    }
    front++;
  }

  int Front() {
    if (front == -1 || front > rear) {
      cout << "Error: queue is empty" << endl;
      return -1;
    }
    return arr[front];
  }

  bool isEmpty() {
    return (front == -1 || front > rear);
  }
};</code></pre>
        <p>In both the stack and queue implementations, we need to be careful about checking for overflow or underflow conditions to avoid accessing memory that is out of bounds. Additionally, it's important to note that arrays have a fixed size, so we need to choose an appropriate size when defining the array.</p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h5>2.1.2 Linked List Representation</h5>
        <p>Alternatively, stacks and queues can be represented using linked lists. In this representation, each element in the data structure is a node containing a data value and a pointer to the next node. In a stack, the top element is the head of the linked list, while in a queue, the front element is the head of the linked list, and the rear element is the tail.</p>
        <p>Here is an implementation of a stack using a linked list in C++:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-cpp">class Node {
public:
int data;
Node* next;

Node(int data) {
this->data = data;
this->next = nullptr;
}
};

class Stack {
private:
Node* top;

public:
Stack() {
this->top = nullptr;
}

void push(int data) {
Node* newNode = new Node(data);
newNode->next = top;
top = newNode;
}

void pop() {
if (top == nullptr) {
cout << "Error: stack underflow" << endl;
return;
}
Node* temp = top;
top = top->next;
delete temp;
}

int Top() {
if (top == nullptr) {
cout << "Error: stack is empty" << endl;
return -1;
}
return top->data;
}

bool isEmpty() {
return top == nullptr;
}
};
</code></pre>

        <p>And here is an implementation of a queue using a linked list in C++:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-cpp">
class Node {
public:
  int data;
  Node* next;
  
  Node(int data) {
    this->data = data;
    this->next = nullptr;
  }
};

class Queue {
private:
  Node* front;
  Node* rear;
  
public:
  Queue() {
    this->front = nullptr;
    this->rear = nullptr;
  }
  
  void enqueue(int data) {
    Node* newNode = new Node(data);
    if (rear == nullptr) {
      front = rear = newNode;
      return;
    }
    rear->next = newNode;
    rear = newNode;
  }
  
  void dequeue() {
    if (front == nullptr) {
      cout << "Error: queue underflow" << endl;
      return;
    }
    Node* temp = front;
    front = front->next;
    if (front == nullptr) {
      rear = nullptr;
    }
    delete temp;
  }
  
  int Front() {
    if (front == nullptr) {
      cout << "Error: queue is empty" << endl;
      return -1;
    }
    return front->data;
  }
  
  bool isEmpty() {
    return front == nullptr;
  }
};
</code></pre>
        <p>Using a linked list to represent a stack or a queue allows for dynamic memory allocation, as the size of the data structure can grow or shrink as needed. However, the linked list implementation is less efficient than the array implementation in terms of memory usage and cache locality. </p>
        <p>Another consideration when using a linked list is the need to properly manage memory, as memory leaks can occur if nodes are not properly deleted when they are no longer needed.</p>
        <p>Overall, the choice between using an array or a linked list to implement a stack or a queue depends on the specific requirements of the application, including the expected size of the data structure, the frequency of insertions and deletions, and the need for dynamic memory allocation.</p>

        <p>One advantage of using a linked list over an array is the ability to easily implement a stack or a queue that can grow or shrink dynamically. For example, if the size of the stack or the queue is unknown, or if it can vary greatly, a linked list implementation may be more appropriate than an array implementation.</p>
        <p>Another advantage of using a linked list is that it allows for constant time insertion and deletion at the front or the rear of the data structure, unlike an array implementation, where such operations can be O(n) in the worst case.</p>
        <p>However, using a linked list also has its disadvantages. In terms of memory usage, a linked list can be less efficient than an array, as each node in the linked list requires additional memory for the pointer to the next node. Additionally, cache locality can be worse in a linked list implementation, as nodes in the linked list may be scattered throughout memory, while an array implementation stores elements in contiguous memory locations.</p>
        <p>Memory management can also be a concern when using a linked list, as nodes need to be properly deleted when they are no longer needed. Failure to do so can result in memory leaks, where memory is allocated but not freed, leading to inefficient use of memory and potential crashes or other errors.</p>

        <h4>2.2 Stacks and Queues Implementations & Applications</h4>
        <p>In parallel algorithms, stacks and queues are often used for tasks such as task scheduling, load balancing, and communication between processes. Common implementations of stacks and queues in parallel algorithms include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Shared-memory stacks and queues, where multiple threads access a single data structure in shared memory.</li>
          <li>Distributed-memory stacks and queues, where each process has its own private stack or queue and communicates with other processes via message passing.</li>
          <li>Lock-free and wait-free stacks and queues, which use atomic operations to synchronize access to the data structure without the need for locks or other synchronization primitives.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>C++ is a popular language for implementing stacks and queues. Here is an example implementation of a stack in C++:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-cpp">
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;
const int MAX = 100;

class Stack {
private:
int top;
int arr[MAX];
public:
Stack() {
top = -1;
}
void push(int x) {
if(top >= MAX-1) {
cout << "Stack Overflow" << endl;
return;
}
arr[++top] = x;
}
void pop() {
if(top < 0) {
cout << "Stack Underflow" << endl;
return;
}
top--;
}
int peek() {
if(top < 0) {
cout << "Stack is Empty" << endl;
return 0;
}
return arr[top];
}
bool isEmpty() {
return (top < 0);
}
};

int main() {
Stack s;
s.push(5);
s.push(10);
s.push(15);
cout << s.peek() << endl;
s.pop();
cout << s.peek() << endl;
s.pop();
cout << s.peek() << endl;
s.pop();
cout << s.peek() << endl;
return 0;
}</code></pre>
        <p>In this implementation, a stack is implemented as a class. The class has four methods: push, pop, peek, and isEmpty. The push method adds an element to the top of the stack, the pop method removes the element from the top of the stack, the peek method returns the element at the top of the stack, and the isEmpty method checks if the stack is empty.</p>
        <p>Similarly, here is an example implementation of a queue in C++:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-cpp">
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

const int MAX = 100;

class Queue {
private:
int front;
int rear;
int arr[MAX];
public:
Queue() {
front = -1;
rear = -1;
}
void enqueue(int x) {
if(rear >= MAX-1) {
cout << "Queue Overflow" << endl;
return;
}
arr[++rear] = x;
if(front == -1) {
front++;
}
}
void dequeue() {
if(front == -1) {
cout << "Queue Underflow" << endl;
return;
}
front++;
if(front > rear) {
front = rear = -1;
}
}
int peek() {
if(front == -1) {
cout << "Queue is Empty" << endl;
return 0;
}
return arr[front];
}
bool isEmpty() {
return (front == -1);
}
};

int main() {
Queue q;
q.enqueue(5);
q.enqueue(10);
q.enqueue(15);
cout << q.peek() << endl;
q.dequeue();
cout << q.peek() << endl;
q.dequeue();
cout << q.peek() << endl;
q.dequeue();
cout << q.peek() << endl;
return 0;
}</code></pre>
        <p>In this implementation, a queue is implemented as a class. The class has four methods: enqueue, dequeue, peek, and isEmpty. The enqueue method adds an element to the rear of the queue, the dequeue method removes the element from the front of the queue, the peek method returns the element at the front of the queue, and the isEmpty method checks if the queue is empty.</p>
        <p>There are many applications of stacks and queues in computer science. For example, in compiler design, a stack is used to keep track of the nesting of program constructs such as loops and conditional statements. In graph algorithms, a queue is used to perform breadth-first search. In operating systems, a stack is used to keep track of function calls and allocate memory for local variables. In network protocols, a queue is used to store packets waiting to be transmitted.</p>

      <article>
        <h4>2.3 Singly Linked Lists</h4>
        <p>A singly linked list is a linear data structure where each element is a node containing a data value and a pointer to the next node. The head of the list is the first element, and the tail is the last element, which points to NULL. Singly linked lists are particularly useful for dynamic data structures, as they allow for efficient insertion and deletion of elements at any position in the list.</p>
        <p>Here is an example of a simple implementation of a singly linked list in C++:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-cpp">class Node {
  public:
    int data;
    Node* next;
};

class LinkedList {
  private:
    Node* head;
  public:
    LinkedList() {
      head = NULL;
    }
    
    void insert(int data) {
      Node* new_node = new Node;
      new_node->data = data;
      new_node->next = head;
      head = new_node;
    }
    
    void remove(int data) {
      Node* current_node = head;
      Node* previous_node = NULL;
      
      while (current_node != NULL && current_node->data != data) {
        previous_node = current_node;
        current_node = current_node->next;
      }
      
      if (current_node == NULL) {
        return;
      }
      
      if (previous_node == NULL) {
        head = current_node->next;
      } else {
        previous_node->next = current_node->next;
      }
      
      delete current_node;
    }
};
    
int main() {
  LinkedList list;
  
  list.insert(3);
  list.insert(2);
  list.insert(1);
  
  list.remove(2);
  
  return 0;
}</code></pre>
        <p>In this implementation, a Node class is defined to represent a single node in the linked list, with an integer data member and a pointer to the next node. A LinkedList class is also defined, with a private head pointer that points to the first node in the list.</p>
        <p>The LinkedList class has two methods, insert() and remove(), which respectively insert a new node with the given data at the beginning of the list and remove the first node with the given data from the list. The insert() method allocates a new node with the given data, sets its next pointer to the current head of the list, and sets the head pointer to the new node. The remove() method iterates over the nodes in the list until it finds a node with the given data, removes the node from the list by updating the previous node's next pointer or the head pointer, and deallocates the memory for the removed node.</p>

      <article>
        <h4>2.4 Doubly Linked Lists</h4>
        <p>A doubly linked list is similar to a singly linked list but with an additional pointer in each node that points to the previous node. This structure allows for more efficient traversal in both directions, as well as easier insertion and deletion of elements at any position in the list. In parallel algorithms, doubly linked lists can be used for various purposes, such as maintaining shared data structures with efficient concurrent access.</p>
        <p>The implementation of a doubly linked list in C++ is straightforward. A node in the doubly linked list can be defined as follows:</p>

        <pre><code class="language-cpp">struct Node {
int data;
Node* next;
Node* prev;
};</code></pre>
        <p>The structure of the doubly linked list can then be defined as:</p>

        <pre><code class="language-cpp">class DoublyLinkedList {
  private:
    Node* head;
    Node* tail;
  public:
    DoublyLinkedList() {
      head = nullptr;
      tail = nullptr;
    }
  // Other member functions
};
</code></pre>
        <p>Here, the head and tail pointers point to the first and last nodes of the doubly linked list, respectively. The implementation of other member functions, such as insert and delete, is similar to that of a singly linked list, but with additional considerations for the previous pointers.</p>

        <p>Traversal of a doubly linked list can be done in both forward and backward directions, as each node has pointers to both its previous and next nodes. The following code snippet demonstrates how to traverse a doubly linked list in the forward direction:</p>

        <pre><code class="language-cpp">void DoublyLinkedList::printForward() {
  Node* current = head;
  while (current != nullptr) {
    std::cout << current->data << " ";
    current = current->next;
  }
}</code></pre>
        <p>Similarly, the following code snippet demonstrates how to traverse a doubly linked list in the backward direction:</p>

        <pre><code class="language-cpp">void DoublyLinkedList::printBackward() {
  Node* current = tail;
  while (current != nullptr) {
  std::cout << current->data << " ";
  current = current->prev;
}

        <p>Doubly Linked Lists provide a more versatile data structure for parallel algorithms, as they allow for efficient concurrent access and modification of shared data structures. In addition, they can be used for various applications, such as implementing LRUs (Least Recently Used) caches, maintaining sorted lists, and implementing undo-redo functionalities in text editors.</p>

        <h4>2.5 Circularly Linked Lists</h4>
        <p>A circularly linked list is a variation of a singly or doubly linked list in which the tail of the list points back to the head, forming a circular structure. This configuration allows for more efficient traversal, as there are no explicit boundaries in the list. In parallel algorithms, circularly linked lists can be used for implementing cyclic data structures, such as circular buffers for inter-process communication.</p>
        <p>In a circularly linked list, the last node of the list points to the first node of the list, rather than to a null pointer. This makes the circularly linked list behave like a circle, with no end or beginning. It can be traversed in both directions from any node, and there is no need to maintain the address of the first node to traverse the list.</p>
        <p>Here is an example implementation of a circularly linked list in C++:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-cpp">
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;
class Node {
public:
int data;
Node* next;
};

class CircularLinkedList {
private:
Node* head;
public:
CircularLinkedList() {
head = NULL;
}
void addNode(int data) {
Node* newNode = new Node();
newNode->data = data;
if(head == NULL) {
head = newNode;
newNode->next = head;
} else {
Node* temp = head;
while(temp->next != head) {
temp = temp->next;
}
temp->next = newNode;
newNode->next = head;
}
}
void display() {
Node* temp = head;
do {
cout << temp->data << " ";
temp = temp->next;
} while(temp != head);
cout << endl;
}
};

int main() {
CircularLinkedList cll;
cll.addNode(1);
cll.addNode(2);
cll.addNode(3);
cll.display();
return 0;
}
</code></pre>
        <p>The above implementation includes a class called "Node" which represents a node in the linked list. The class "CircularLinkedList" contains a private member variable called "head" which points to the first node of the list. The "addNode" function adds a new node to the list and the "display" function prints the data of all nodes in the list.</p>
        <p>One common operation on a circularly linked list is deletion of a node. Here is an example implementation of a function to delete a node with a given value:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-cpp">void CircularLinkedList::deleteNode(int data) {
  Node* temp = head;
  if(head == NULL) {
    return;
  }
  if(head->data == data) {
    while(temp->next != head) {
      temp = temp->next;
    }
    if(head == head->next) {
      delete head;
      head = NULL;
      return;
    }
  temp->next = head->next;
  delete head;
  head = temp->next;
  } else {
    Node* prev;
    while(temp->next != head && temp->data != data) {
      prev = temp;
      temp = temp->next;
    }
    if(temp->data != data) {
      return;
    }
    prev->next = temp->next;
    delete temp;
  }
}
</code></pre>
        <p>The above function iterates through the linked list until it finds a node with the given value. If the node is the first node in the list, it updates the "head" pointer to point to the next node in the list. If the node is not the first node in the list, it updates the "next" pointer of the previous node to point to the next node after the node being deleted.</p>
        <p>Circularly linked lists can also be used to implement other data structures, such as circular queues. Here is an example implementation of a circular queue using a circularly linked list:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-cpp">class CircularQueue {
private:
  Node* rear;
public:
  CircularQueue() {
    rear = NULL;
  }
  bool isEmpty() {
    return rear == NULL;
  }
  void enqueue(int data) {
    Node* newNode = new Node();
    newNode->data = data;
    if(isEmpty()) {
      rear = newNode;
      newNode->next = rear;
    } else {
      newNode->next = rear->next;
      rear->next = newNode;
      rear = newNode;
    }
  }
  int dequeue() {
    int data;
    if(isEmpty()) {
      return -1;
    } else if(rear == rear->next) {
      data = rear->data;
      delete rear;
      rear = NULL;
    } else {
      Node* temp = rear->next;
      data = temp->data;
      rear->next = temp->next;
      delete temp;
    }
  return data;
  }
};</code></pre>
        <p>The above implementation includes a class called "CircularQueue" which uses a circularly linked list to implement a queue. The "enqueue" function adds an element to the rear of the queue, and the "dequeue" function removes an element from the front of the queue.</p>
        <p>Circularly linked lists offer advantages over other types of linked lists in certain scenarios, such as when implementing cyclic data structures or when traversal in both directions is required. However, they can be more difficult to implement and manage than singly or doubly linked lists.</p>

        <h3>3. Operations on Linked Lists</h3>
        <p>In this section, we will discuss various operations that can be performed on linked lists, including insertion, deletion, and traversal. We will also cover memory allocation strategies for linked lists in parallel algorithms.</p>
      </article>

        <h4>3.1 Insertion</h4>
        <p>Insertion in a linked list involves adding a new element at a specified position in the list. Depending on the type of linked list (singly, doubly, or circularly linked) and the desired position, different insertion strategies are used. In parallel algorithms, efficient and concurrent insertion is crucial to minimize contention and ensure the scalability of the algorithm.</p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h5>3.1.1 Singly Linked List Insertion</h5>
        <p>To insert an element in a singly linked list, we first create a new node with the given data value and a pointer to the next node. Then, we update the pointers of the adjacent nodes to include the new node in the list. The complexity of this operation is O(1) if the insertion position is known or O(n) if we need to search for the position.</p>
        <p>The following C++ code demonstrates how to insert an element at the head of a singly linked list:</p>

        <pre><code class="language-cpp">
void insertAtHead(Node** headRef, int data){
    Node* newNode = new Node(data);
    newNode->next = *headRef;
    *headRef = newNode;
}
</code></pre>

        <p>The above code creates a new node with the given data value and a pointer to the current head of the list. It then updates the head of the list to point to the new node. The double pointer headRef is used so that the head of the list can be updated outside of the function.</p>

        <p>The following C++ code demonstrates how to insert an element at the end of a singly linked list:</p>

        <pre><code class="language-cpp">
void insertAtTail(Node** headRef, int data){
    Node* newNode = new Node(data);
    newNode->next = NULL;
    if (*headRef == NULL){
        *headRef = newNode;
        return;
    }
    Node* currNode = *headRef;
    while (currNode->next != NULL){
        currNode = currNode->next;
    }
    currNode->next = newNode;
}
</code></pre>

        <p>The above code creates a new node with the given data value and a pointer to NULL. If the list is empty, it updates the head of the list to point to the new node. Otherwise, it traverses the list until it reaches the last node and updates its next pointer to point to the new node.</p>

      </article>
      <article>
        <h5>3.1.2 Doubly Linked List Insertion</h5>
        <p>Insertion in a doubly linked list is similar to a singly linked list, but with the additional step of updating the previous pointer of the adjacent nodes. This operation has the same complexity as the singly linked list insertion.</p>
        <p>The following code snippet demonstrates the insertion of a node at the beginning of a doubly linked list:</p>

        <pre><code class="language-cpp">struct Node {
  int data;
  Node* next;
  Node* prev;
};

void insertAtBeginning(Node** head_ref, int new_data) {
  Node* new_node = new Node;
  new_node->data = new_data;
  new_node->next = (*head_ref);
  new_node->prev = NULL;
  if ((*head_ref) != NULL) {
    (*head_ref)->prev = new_node;
  }
  (*head_ref) = new_node;
}</code></pre>
        <p>The function `insertAtBeginning()` takes a pointer to the head node of the doubly linked list and the data of the new node to be inserted. It first creates a new node with the given data and sets its next pointer to the current head node of the list. It also sets the previous pointer of the new node to NULL since it is being inserted at the beginning of the list. If the list is not empty, the previous pointer of the current head node is updated to point to the new node. Finally, the head pointer is updated to point to the new node.</p>

        <p>The following code snippet demonstrates the insertion of a node at the end of a doubly linked list:</p>

        <pre><code class="language-cpp">void insertAtEnd(Node** head_ref, int new_data) {
  Node* new_node = new Node;
  new_node->data = new_data;
  new_node->next = NULL;
  Node* last = (*head_ref);
  if ((*head_ref) == NULL) {
    new_node->prev = NULL;
    (*head_ref) = new_node;
    return;
  }
  while (last->next != NULL) {
    last = last->next;
  }
  last->next = new_node;
  new_node->prev = last;
}</code></pre>
        <p>The function `insertAtEnd()` takes a pointer to the head node of the doubly linked list and the data of the new node to be inserted. It first creates a new node with the given data and sets its next pointer to NULL since it is being inserted at the end of the list. It then traverses the list to find the last node and sets its next pointer to the new node. The previous pointer of the new node is set to point to the last node. If the list is empty, the new node is simply inserted as the first node.</p>
      </article>

      <article>
        <h5>3.1.3 Circularly Linked List Insertion</h5>
        <p>Inserting an element in a circularly linked list is similar to inserting in a singly or doubly linked list, with the additional step of updating the tail pointer if the new element is inserted at the head or tail of the list. The complexity of this operation is the same as the other linked list insertion methods.</p>
        <p>The following code snippet shows how to insert a new node at the head of a circular linked list:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-cpp">
Node* CircularLinkedList::insertAtHead(int data) {
    Node* newNode = new Node(data);
    if (head == nullptr) {
        head = tail = newNode;
        tail->next = head;
    }
    else {
        newNode->next = head;
        head = newNode;
        tail->next = head;
    }
    return newNode;
}
        </code></pre>
        <p>The above code first creates a new node with the given data and assigns it to a pointer variable named "newNode". If the list is empty, the new node becomes both the head and tail of the list, and its "next" pointer is set to point to itself. Otherwise, the new node is inserted at the head of the list by updating the "next" pointer of the new node to point to the current head, and then updating the "head" pointer to point to the new node. Finally, the "next" pointer of the tail node is updated to point to the new head.</p>
        <p>The following code snippet shows how to insert a new node at the tail of a circular linked list:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-cpp">
Node* CircularLinkedList::insertAtTail(int data) {
    Node* newNode = new Node(data);
    if (head == nullptr) {
        head = tail = newNode;
        tail->next = head;
    }
    else {
        tail->next = newNode;
        tail = newNode;
        tail->next = head;
    }
    return newNode;
}
        </code></pre>
        <p>The above code first creates a new node with the given data and assigns it to a pointer variable named "newNode". If the list is empty, the new node becomes both the head and tail of the list, and its "next" pointer is set to point to itself. Otherwise, the new node is inserted at the tail of the list by updating the "next" pointer of the current tail node to point to the new node, and then updating the "tail" pointer to point to the new node. Finally, the "next" pointer of the new tail node is updated to point to the head of the list.</p>

        <h4>3.2 Deletion</h4>
        <p>Deletion in a linked list involves removing an element from the list and updating the pointers of the adjacent nodes. In parallel algorithms, efficient and concurrent deletion is essential to prevent contention and maintain the scalability of the algorithm.</p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h5>3.2.1 Singly Linked List Deletion</h5>
        <p>To delete an element in a singly linked list, we first locate the node to be deleted and then update the next pointer of the previous node to point to the node after the one being deleted. Finally, we deallocate the memory of the deleted node. The complexity of this operation is O(1) if the position is known or O(n) if we need to search for the position.</p>
        <p>To delete the node at a known position, we first need to check if the position is valid (i.e., not less than 1 or greater than the length of the list). Then, we traverse the list until we reach the node just before the one to be deleted. We update its next pointer to point to the node after the one being deleted, and then deallocate the memory of the deleted node.</p>
        <pre><code class="language-cpp">void deleteNode(int position) {
    // check if position is valid
    if (position < 1 || position > length) {
        cout << "Invalid position" << endl;
        return;
    }
    // traverse the list until the node just before the one to be deleted
    Node* curr = head;
    for (int i = 1; i < position - 1; i++) {
        curr = curr->next;
    }
    // update next pointer of previous node to point to the node after the one being deleted
    Node* temp = curr->next;
    curr->next = temp->next;
    // deallocate memory of the deleted node
    delete temp;
    // update length of list
    length--;
}</code></pre>
        <p>If we don't know the position of the node to be deleted, we need to search for it. In this case, the time complexity of the deletion operation is O(n). We can use a similar approach as for searching, but we also need to keep track of the previous node so we can update its next pointer. If the node to be deleted is the head of the list, we simply update the head pointer to point to the next node.</p>
        <pre><code class="language-cpp">void deleteNode(int key) {
    // special case: if node to be deleted is head
    if (head != nullptr && head->data == key) {
        Node* temp = head;

        delete temp;

        <p>Deletion in a doubly linked list is similar to a singly linked list, but with the additional step of updating the previous pointer of the node after the one being deleted. This operation has the same complexity as the singly linked list deletion.</p>
        <p>To delete a node with a given value in a doubly linked list, we must first find the node, then update the pointers of the previous and next nodes to bypass the node to be deleted. Here's an implementation in C++:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-cpp">struct Node {
  int data;

    *head_ref = temp->next;
  }
  if (temp->next != NULL) {
    temp->next->prev = temp->prev;
  }
  free(temp);
}</code></pre>
        <p>In this code, we pass in a pointer to the head of the list as well as the value of the node to be deleted. We then traverse the list to find the node with that value. Once we have found it, we update the pointers of the previous and next nodes to bypass the node, and then free the memory associated with it.</p>

        <h5>3.2.3 Circularly Linked List Deletion</h5>

        <p>Deleting an element in a circularly linked list is similar to deleting in a singly or doubly linked list, with the additional step of updating the tail pointer if the element being deleted is the head or tail of the list. The complexity of this operation is the same as the other linked list deletion methods.</p>
        <p>In C++, to delete an element from a circularly linked list, we can define a function that takes in the head pointer and the value to be deleted as parameters. The function can iterate through the list until it finds the node with the specified value and then delete it, updating the head and tail pointers as necessary. Here's an example:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-cpp">struct Node {
  int data;
  Node* next;
};

void deleteCircularLinkedListNode(Node* &head, int value) {
  // If list is empty, return
  if (head == NULL)
    return;
  // Find the node with the specified value
  Node* curr = head;
  Node* prev = NULL;
  while (curr->data != value) {
      if (curr->next == head) // If value not found, return
          return;

      prev = curr;
      curr = curr->next;
  }

  // If node to be deleted is the only node in the list
  if (head == curr && curr->next == head) {
      head = NULL;
      free(curr);
      return;
  }

  // If node to be deleted is the first node
  if (head == curr) {
      prev = head;
      while (prev->next != head)
          prev = prev->next;
      head = curr->next;
      prev->next = head;
      free(curr);
  }

  // If node to be deleted is the last node
  else if (curr->next == head) {
      prev->next = head;
      free(curr);
  }

  // If node to be deleted is in the middle
  else {
      prev->next = curr->next;
      free(curr);
  }
}</code></pre>
        <p>The above code defines a function <code>deleteCircularLinkedListNode()</code> that takes in the head pointer of the circularly linked list and the value to be deleted. It first checks if the list is empty, and if so, returns. Then, it iterates through the list until it finds the node with the specified value. If the value is not found, the function returns. If the node to be deleted is the only node in the list, the head pointer is set to NULL and the node is freed. If the node to be deleted is the first node, the head pointer is updated to the next node and the tail pointer is updated to point to the new head. If the node to be deleted is the last node, the tail pointer is updated to point to the second-to-last node. If the node to be deleted is in the middle, the previous node's <code>next</code> pointer is updated to skip over the node to be deleted.</p>

        <h4>3.3 Traversal</h4>
        <p>Traversal in a linked list involves visiting each element in the list, typically for the purpose of processing or searching for a specific value. In parallel algorithms, efficient traversal is important to ensure that multiple threads or processes can access the data structure simultaneously without contention.</p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h5>3.3.1 Singly Linked List Traversal</h5>
        <p>To traverse a singly linked list, we start at the head of the list and follow the next pointers until we reach the tail, which points to NULL. The complexity of this operation is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list.</p>
        <p>The traversal operation can be implemented using a loop that iterates through the list until the tail is reached. Here is an example implementation in C++:</p>

        <pre><code class="language-cpp">void traverseLinkedList(Node* head) {
    Node* current = head;
    while(current != NULL) {
        // Do something with current node, e.g. print value
        std::cout << current->data << std::endl;
        current = current->next;
    }
}</code></pre>

        <p>In the code snippet above, the function `traverseLinkedList` takes a pointer to the head of the list as input and iterates through the list using a while loop. The loop condition checks if the current node is not NULL, i.e. if there are still nodes left to traverse. Inside the loop, we can perform any operation on the current node, such as printing its value, before moving on to the next node using the `next` pointer.</p>

        <p>It's worth noting that traversal can also be implemented recursively, although this may not be the most efficient approach for large lists. Here is an example recursive implementation:</p>

        <pre><code class="language-cpp">void traverseLinkedListRecursive(Node* node) {
    if(node != NULL) {
        // Do something with current node, e.g. print value
        std::cout << node->data << std::endl;
        traverseLinkedListRecursive(node->next);
    }
}</code></pre>

        <p>In the recursive implementation, the function `traverseLinkedListRecursive` takes a pointer to the current node as input and recursively calls itself with the next node until the end of the list is reached.</p>
      </article>

      <article>
        <h5>3.3.2 Doubly Linked List Traversal</h5>
        <p>Traversal in a doubly linked list is similar to a singly linked list, but with the added ability to traverse the list in reverse by following the previous pointers. The complexity of this operation is O(n) in either direction.</p>
        <p>To traverse a doubly linked list in the forward direction, we can simply start at the head node and follow the next pointers until we reach the end of the list. Here is an example C++ code for traversing a doubly linked list:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-cpp">void traverse_forward(Node* head) {
    Node* current = head;
    while (current != NULL) {
        // Process current node
        cout << current->data << " ";
        // Move to next node
        current = current->next;
    }
}</code></pre>
        <p>To traverse the list in reverse, we can start at the tail node and follow the previous pointers until we reach the beginning of the list. Here is an example C++ code for traversing a doubly linked list in reverse:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-cpp">void traverse_reverse(Node* tail) {
    Node* current = tail;
    while (current != NULL) {
        // Process current node
        cout << current->data << " ";
        // Move to previous node
        current = current->prev;
    }
}</code></pre>
        <p>Both of these functions have a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the list.</p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h5>3.3.3 Circularly Linked List Traversal</h5>
        <p>Traversing a circularly linked list is similar to traversing a singly or doubly linked list, but with the added challenge of identifying the end of the list, as the tail points back to the head. One common method to handle this is to use a sentinel node or a flag to mark the end of the list. The complexity of this operation is O(n).</p>
        <p>To traverse a circularly linked list, we can start at the head and visit each node until we reach the head again. The traversal can be implemented using a loop that continues until the current node is equal to the head of the list. Inside the loop, we can perform any operations we want on the current node, such as printing its value or updating its contents.</p>
        <pre><code class="language-cpp">void traverseCircularLinkedList(Node* head) {
    if (head == NULL) {
        return;
    }
    Node* current = head;
    do {
        // Perform operations on current node
        std::cout << current->data << " ";
        current = current->next;
    } while (current != head);
}</code></pre>
        <p>In the above code, we start by checking if the head is NULL. If it is, we simply return without performing any operations. Otherwise, we initialize a pointer called current to point to the head. We then use a do-while loop to traverse the list. Inside the loop, we perform the desired operations on the current node and then update the current pointer to point to the next node in the list. The loop continues until the current pointer is equal to the head pointer, indicating that we have completed a full traversal of the list.</p>

        <h3>4. Memory Allocation</h3>
        <p>In parallel algorithms, efficient memory allocation is crucial to ensure the scalability and performance of the algorithm. In this section, we will discuss various memory allocation strategies for linked lists in parallel algorithms.</p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h4>4.1 Static Memory Allocation</h4>
        <p>Static memory allocation involves reserving a fixed amount of memory for the linked list at compile-time. This approach is simple and efficient, as it does not require dynamic memory allocation, which can be a source of contention in parallel algorithms. However, static memory allocation may be wasteful if the actual size of the linked list is much smaller than the reserved size, or it may be insufficient if the linked list grows beyond the reserved size.</p>
        <p>The following code snippet illustrates an example of static memory allocation of a linked list:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-cpp">struct ListNode {
  int val;
  ListNode* next;
};

const int kMaxNodes = 10000;
ListNode nodes[kMaxNodes];
int node_count = 0;

ListNode* create_node(int val) {
  assert(node_count < kMaxNodes);
  ListNode* node = &nodes[node_count++];
  node->val = val;
  node->next = nullptr;
  return node;
}

int main() {
  ListNode* head = create_node(1);
  head->next = create_node(2);
  head->next->next = create_node(3);
  // ...
  return 0;
}
</code></pre>
        <p>In this example, an array of <code>kMaxNodes</code>, <code>ListNode</code> objects is declared at compile-time. The <code>node_count</code> variable keeps track of the number of nodes used so far, and the <code>create_node</code> function returns a pointer to a new node from the <code>nodes</code> array. This approach avoids dynamic memory allocation, but limits the maximum size of the linked list to <code>kMaxNodes</code>.</p>

        <h4>4.2 Dynamic Memory Allocation</h4>
        <p>Dynamic memory allocation allows the linked list to grow and shrink during the execution of the algorithm by allocating and deallocating memory as needed. While this approach is more flexible than static memory allocation, it can lead to contention and performance issues in parallel algorithms due to the synchronization overhead of memory allocation routines.</p>
        <p>C++ provides the operators new and delete for dynamic memory allocation and deallocation, respectively. The new operator allocates memory and initializes the object, while the delete operator deallocates the memory and destroys the object.</p>
        <p>The following code demonstrates how to dynamically allocate memory for a linked list node using the new operator:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-cpp">struct Node {
    int data;
    Node* next;
};
Node* newNode(int data) {
Node* node = new Node;
node->data = data;
node->next = NULL;
return node;
}</code></pre>
        <p>In the above code, the new operator is used to allocate memory for a new Node struct, and the pointer to this new node is returned by the function. The delete operator can be used to deallocate the memory allocated by new as follows:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-cpp">void deleteNode(Node* node) {
delete node;
}</code></pre>
        <p>It is important to note that dynamically allocated memory should always be deallocated when it is no longer needed to avoid memory leaks.</p>
        <p>When implementing parallel algorithms using dynamic memory allocation, it is important to minimize the number of memory allocation and deallocation operations, as these can cause contention and performance issues. One approach to achieving this is to pre-allocate a large pool of memory and manage it using a memory pool or a custom memory allocator.</p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h4>4.3 Memory Pools</h4>
        <p>Memory pools are a common technique used in parallel algorithms to improve the efficiency of dynamic memory allocation. A memory pool is a pre-allocated block of memory that is divided into smaller chunks, which can be allocated and deallocated as needed. Memory pools reduce the synchronization overhead of dynamic memory allocation by allowing each thread or process to allocate memory from its own private pool, minimizing contention and improving scalability.</p>
        <p>Memory pools are especially useful in applications that allocate and deallocate memory frequently, such as in network servers or databases. By using a memory pool, an application can reduce the number of system calls and memory fragmentation, leading to better performance and reduced memory usage.</p>

        <p>The following is an example of a simple memory pool implementation in C++:</p>

        <pre><code class="language-cpp">class MemoryPool {
  public:
    MemoryPool(size_t blockSize, size_t numBlocks) {
        mBlockSize = blockSize;
        mNumBlocks = numBlocks;
        mPoolSize = blockSize * numBlocks;
        mPool = new char[mPoolSize];
        mFreeList = (void**)mPool;
        for (size_t i = 0; i < numBlocks - 1; i++) {
            void** curr = (void**)(mPool + (i * blockSize));
            void** next = (void**)(mPool + ((i + 1) * blockSize));
            *curr = next;
        }
        void** last = (void**)(mPool + ((numBlocks - 1) * blockSize));
        *last = NULL;
    }

  ~MemoryPool() {
      delete[] mPool;
  }

  void* allocate() {
      if (mFreeList == NULL) {
          return NULL;
      }
      void* ptr = mFreeList;
      mFreeList = (void**)(*mFreeList);
      return ptr;
  }

  void deallocate(void* ptr) {
      void** next = (void**)mFreeList;
      mFreeList = (void**)ptr;
      *mFreeList = next;
  }

  private:
      size_t mBlockSize;
      size_t mNumBlocks;
      size_t mPoolSize;
      char* mPool;
      void** mFreeList;
};</code></pre>

        <p>The MemoryPool class takes two arguments: blockSize and numBlocks. blockSize specifies the size of each block, and numBlocks specifies the number of blocks in the pool. The class allocates a block of memory large enough to hold all the blocks, and initializes a linked list of free blocks. The allocate() function returns a pointer to the next free block, and the deallocate() function adds the block back to the free list.</p>

        <p>Using a memory pool in your code is straightforward. Simply create an instance of the MemoryPool class, and use the allocate() and deallocate() functions to manage memory:</p>

        <pre><code class="language-cpp">MemoryPool pool(sizeof(MyStruct), 1000);
MyStruct* ptr = (MyStruct*)pool.allocate();
// Use ptr
pool.deallocate(ptr);</code></pre>

        <p>In this example, we create a memory pool of 1000 blocks, each the size of MyStruct. We then allocate a block of memory from the pool using the allocate() function, and use it as a MyStruct*. When we are finished with the block, we return it to the pool using the deallocate() function.</p>

        <h4>4.4 Lock-free and Wait-free Memory Allocation</h4>
        <p>Lock-free and wait-free memory allocation are advanced techniques that use atomic operations to allocate and deallocate memory without the need for locks or other synchronization primitives. These techniques can significantly improve the performance and scalability of parallel algorithms, but they are also more complex to implement and may not be supported on all platforms or architectures.</p>
        <p>One example of a lock-free memory allocation algorithm is the Michael-Scott queue algorithm. This algorithm uses compare-and-swap (CAS) operations to allocate and deallocate nodes in a linked list. Here is an implementation of the Michael-Scott queue algorithm in C++:</p>

        <pre><code class="language-cpp">template &lt;typename T>
class LockFreeQueue {
  private:
    struct Node {
      T data;
      std::atomic&lt;Node*> next;
    };
  std::atomic&lt;Node*> head;
  std::atomic&lt;Node*> tail;

  public:
    LockFreeQueue() {
      head = tail = new Node();
      head.load()->next = nullptr;
  }
  ~LockFreeQueue() {
    while (head != nullptr) {
        Node* temp = head.load();
        head = temp->next;
        delete temp;
    }
  }

  void enqueue(const T& data) {
      Node* node = new Node();
      node->data = data;
      node->next = nullptr;
      Node* prevTail = tail.exchange(node);
      prevTail->next = node;
  }

  bool dequeue(T& result) {
      Node* oldHead = head.load();
      Node* newHead = oldHead->next;
      if (newHead == nullptr) {
          return false;
      }
      result = newHead->data;
      if (head.compare_exchange_strong(oldHead, newHead)) {
          delete oldHead;
          return true;
      }
      return false;
  }
};</code></pre>
        <p>In this implementation, the enqueue operation allocates a new node and uses an atomic exchange operation to update the tail pointer. The dequeue operation uses a compare-and-swap operation to atomically update the head pointer and avoid race conditions with other threads.</p>

        <p>Wait-free memory allocation is a more advanced technique that guarantees that all threads will make progress even in the presence of contention. One example of a wait-free memory allocation algorithm is the Treiber stack algorithm, which uses atomic operations to implement a lock-free stack. Here is an implementation of the Treiber stack algorithm in C++:</p>

        <pre><code class="language-cpp">
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;atomic&gt;

template &lt;typename T&gt;
class WaitFreeStack {
  private:
    struct Node {
        T data;
        std::atomic&lt;Node*&gt; next;
        Node(const T& d) : data(d), next(nullptr) {}
    };
    std::atomic&lt;Node*> head;

  public:
    WaitFreeStack() {
        head = nullptr;
    }

    ~WaitFreeStack() {
        while (head != nullptr) {
            Node* temp = head.load();
            head = temp->next;
            delete temp;
        }
    }

    void push(const T& data) {
        Node* node = new Node(data);
        node->next = head.load();
        while (!head.compare_exchange_weak(node->next, node)) {}
    }

    bool pop(T& result) {
        Node* oldHead = head.load();
        while (oldHead != nullptr && !head.compare_exchange_weak(oldHead, oldHead->next)) {}
        if (oldHead == nullptr) {
            return false;
        }
        result = oldHead->data;
        delete oldHead;
        return true;
    }
};

int main() {
    WaitFreeStack&lt;int> stack;

    stack.push(1);
    stack.push(2);
    stack.push(3);

    int result = 0;

    while (stack.pop(result)) {
        std::cout << result << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
</code></pre>
        <p>In this example, we create a new instance of the WaitFreeStack class and use it to push three integers onto the stack. We then use a while loop to repeatedly call the pop method and print the popped integers to the console until the stack is empty. The output of this program will be:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-cpp">3
2
1
</code></pre>
        <p>As expected, the popped integers are printed in reverse order from the order in which they were pushed onto the stack.</p>
        <p>In this implementation, the push operation allocates a new node and uses a loop with a compare-and-swap operation to atomically update the head pointer. The pop operation uses a loop with a compare-and-swap operation to atomically update the head pointer and avoid race conditions with other threads.</p>

        <p>In this section, we will cover advanced topics in parallel algorithms and data structures, suitable for computer science students and researchers working in the field.

        <h4>5.1 Parallel Searching Algorithms</h4>
        <p>Parallel searching algorithms aim to find a specific element in a data structure by dividing the search space among multiple threads or processes, thereby speeding up the search process. Common parallel searching algorithms include parallel binary search, parallel depth-first search (DFS), and parallel breadth-first search (BFS).</p>
        <p>Parallel binary search is an algorithm that divides the search space into multiple segments and assigns each segment to a separate thread. Each thread then performs a binary search on its assigned segment, and the results are combined to determine whether the element is present in the data structure. Here is an example implementation of parallel binary search in C++:</p>

        <pre><code class="language-cpp">bool parallel_binary_search(int* arr, int n, int x) {
    bool found = false;
    #pragma omp parallel
    {
        int tid = omp_get_thread_num();
        int low = tid * (n / omp_get_num_threads());
        int high = (tid + 1) * (n / omp_get_num_threads()) - 1;
        if (tid == omp_get_num_threads() - 1) high = n - 1;
        
        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            if (arr[mid] == x) {
                #pragma omp critical
                {
                    found = true;
                    break;
                }
            }
            else if (arr[mid] < x) {
                low = mid + 1;
            }
            else {
                high = mid - 1;
            }
        }
    }
    return found;
}</code></pre>

        <p>Parallel depth-first search (DFS) and parallel breadth-first search (BFS) are algorithms commonly used for searching trees and graphs. In parallel DFS, the search space is divided among multiple threads, and each thread explores a separate subtree of the tree or graph until the target element is found. In parallel BFS, the search space is divided into multiple levels, with each level assigned to a separate thread. Here is an example implementation of parallel DFS in C++:</p>

        <pre><code class="language-cpp">bool parallel_dfs(Node* root, int x) {
    bool found = false;
    #pragma omp parallel
    {
        stack<Node*> s;
        int tid = omp_get_thread_num();
        if (tid == 0) {
            s.push(root);
        }
        else {
            int num_threads = omp_get_num_threads();
            int subtree_size = ceil((double)root->size() / num_threads);
            int start_index = tid * subtree_size;
            int end_index = min(start_index + subtree_size, root->size());
            for (int i = start_index; i < end_index; i++) {
                s.push((*root)[i]);
            }
        }
        
        while (!s.empty()) {
            Node* curr = s.top();
            s.pop();
            if (curr->val == x) {
                #pragma omp critical
                {
                    found = true;
                    break;
                }
            }
            for (Node* child : curr->children) {
                s.push(child);
            }
        }
    }
    return found;
}</code></pre>

        <p>Note that the above implementation assumes that the tree is represented as a vector of nodes, where each node has a value and a list of children nodes. Parallel BFS can be implemented similarly, with each thread assigned a separate level of the tree or graph to explore.</p>

        <h4>5.2 Parallel Sorting Algorithms</h4>
        <p>Parallel sorting algorithms aim to sort a set of elements by distributing the sorting task among multiple threads or processes. Some well-known parallel sorting algorithms include parallel merge sort, parallel quicksort, and parallel radix sort. These algorithms often leverage techniques such as divide-and-conquer, pipelining, and load balancing to improve their efficiency and scalability in parallel environments.</p>
        <p>Parallel merge sort is a popular parallel sorting algorithm that works by dividing the input data into multiple subsets and sorting them independently using multiple threads or processes. Once the subsets are sorted, the algorithm merges them together to produce the final sorted result. Here is a sample implementation of parallel merge sort in C++:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-cpp">
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;algorithm&gt;
#include &lt;vector&gt;
#include &lt;thread&gt;
// Parallel merge sort
template &lt;typename T&gt;
void parallel_merge_sort(std::vector&lt;T&gt;& v)
{
if(v.size() <= 1) return;
// Divide the input vector into two halves
auto mid = v.begin() + v.size() / 2;
std::vector&lt;T> left(v.begin(), mid);
std::vector&lt;T> right(mid, v.end());

// Sort the two halves in parallel
std::thread t1(parallel_merge_sort&lt;T>, std::ref(left));
std::thread t2(parallel_merge_sort&lt;T>, std::ref(right));
t1.join();
t2.join();

// Merge the two sorted halves
std::inplace_merge(v.begin(), mid, v.end());
}

int main()
{
// Sample usage
std::vector&lt;int> v = {3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5};
parallel_merge_sort(v);
for(auto x : v) std::cout << x << " ";
std::cout << std::endl;
return 0;
}
</code></pre>
        <p>Parallel quicksort is another popular parallel sorting algorithm that works by partitioning the input data into two subsets, one with elements smaller than a chosen pivot and another with elements greater than or equal to the pivot. The algorithm then sorts the two subsets independently using multiple threads or processes. Here is a sample implementation of parallel quicksort in C++:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-cpp">
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;algorithm&gt;
#include &lt;vector&gt;
#include &lt;thread&gt;

// Parallel quicksort
template&lt;typename T>
void parallel_quicksort(std::vector<T>& v)
{
if(v.size() <= 1) return;
// Choose a pivot element
T pivot = v[v.size() / 2];

// Partition the vector into two halves
auto mid = std::partition(v.begin(), v.end(),
    [&](const T& t) { return t < pivot; });

// Sort the two halves in parallel
std::thread t1(parallel_quicksort&lt;T>, std::ref(std::vector&lt;T>(v.begin(), mid)));
std::thread t2(parallel_quicksort&lt;T>, std::ref(std::vector&lt;T>(mid, v.end())));
t1.join();
t2.join();

// Merge the two sorted halves
std::inplace_merge(v.begin(), mid, v.end());
}

int main()
{
// Sample usage
std::vector&lt;int> v = {3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5};
  parallel_quicksort(v);
  for(auto x : v) std::cout << x << " " ; std::cout << std::endl; return 0;
}</code></pre>
        <p>Parallel radix sort is a parallel sorting algorithm that works by sorting the input data one digit at a time, starting from the least significant digit. The algorithm distributes the sorting task among multiple threads or processes by dividing the input data into buckets based on the value of the current digit. The buckets are then sorted independently using multiple threads or processes. Here is a sample implementation of parallel radix sort in C++:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-cpp">
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;algorithm&gt;
#include &lt;vector&gt;
#include &lt;thread&gt;

void parallel_radix_sort(std::vector&lt;T>& v)
{
// Determine the maximum number of digits
int max_digits = 0;
for(auto x : v) max_digits = std::max(max_digits, (int)std::to_string(x).size());
// Sort the input data one digit at a time
for(int i = 0; i < max_digits; ++i) { // Divide the input data into buckets based on the value of the current digit std::vector&lt;std::vector&lt;T>> buckets(10);
  for(auto x : v) buckets[(x / static_cast<T>(pow(10, i))) % 10].push_back(x);

    // Merge the sorted buckets back into the input data
    int index = 0;
    for(auto& bucket : buckets)
    {
    std::thread t(parallel_radix_sort<T>, std::ref(bucket));
      t.join();
      std::move(bucket.begin(), bucket.end(), v.begin() + index);
      index += bucket.size();
      }
      }
}

int main()
{
  // Sample usage
  std::vector&lt;int> v = {3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5};

        <h4>5.3 Parallel Graph Traversal Algorithms</h4>
        <p>Parallel graph traversal algorithms are designed to explore the vertices and edges of a graph in parallel, often for tasks such as shortest path finding, connected component detection, and graph partitioning. Common parallel graph traversal algorithms include parallel DFS, parallel BFS, and parallel Dijkstra's algorithm.</p>
        <p>Parallel DFS algorithm is used to traverse a graph in parallel using a depth-first search approach. The algorithm maintains a stack of vertices to visit and processes vertices in parallel until the stack is empty. The following code snippet shows the implementation of parallel DFS algorithm in C++:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-cpp">
void parallel_dfs(int vertex, bool visited[], vector&lt;int> adj_list[], int num_threads) {

            int current_vertex = st.top();
            st.pop();

            if (!visited[current_vertex]) {
                visited[current_vertex] = true;

                #pragma omp parallel for num_threads(num_threads)
                for (int i = 0; i < adj_list[current_vertex].size(); i++) {
                    int neighbor = adj_list[current_vertex][i];
                    if (!visited[neighbor]) {
                        st.push(neighbor);
                    }

        }
    }

        <p>Parallel BFS algorithm is used to traverse a graph in parallel using a breadth-first search approach. The algorithm maintains a queue of vertices to visit and processes vertices in parallel until the queue is empty. The following code snippet shows the implementation of parallel BFS algorithm in C++:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-cpp">
    void parallel_bfs(int vertex, bool visited[], vector&lt;int> adj_list[], int num_threads) {

        <p>Parallel graph traversal algorithms can be implemented using various parallel programming paradigms such as OpenMP, MPI, and CUDA. OpenMP is a shared-memory parallel programming model that supports parallel for loops and parallel sections. MPI is a message passing parallel programming model that supports parallel communication between multiple processes. CUDA is a parallel computing platform and programming model that supports parallel execution on NVIDIA GPUs.</p>
        <p>The choice of parallel programming paradigm for implementing parallel graph traversal algorithms depends on various factors such as the size of the graph, the number of threads, the amount of memory required, and the desired performance. For large graphs with millions or billions of vertices, MPI and CUDA may be more suitable due to their distributed and parallel computing capabilities. However, for small to medium-sized graphs, OpenMP may be sufficient and easier to implement.</p>

        <h4>5.4 Concurrent Data Structures</h4>
        <p>Concurrent data structures are data structures that are designed for efficient and safe concurrent access by multiple threads or processes. They typically employ advanced synchronization techniques, such as lock-free and wait-free algorithms, to minimize contention and improve scalability. Examples of concurrent data structures include concurrent hash tables, concurrent priority queues, and concurrent search trees.</p>
        <p>In order to implement a concurrent data structure, we need to ensure that access to the data structure is synchronized in a way that allows for multiple threads to read or write to it at the same time without causing data corruption or inconsistent results. One common way to achieve this is through the use of locks, which are mechanisms that prevent multiple threads from accessing the same piece of data at the same time.</p>

        <p>However, locks can be expensive to acquire and release, and can lead to contention if multiple threads are trying to access the same lock. To avoid this, lock-free algorithms use non-blocking synchronization techniques that do not require locks, such as atomic operations and compare-and-swap (CAS) instructions.</p>

        <p>One example of a lock-free data structure is the lock-free queue, which allows multiple threads to enqueue and dequeue items concurrently without the need for locks. Here is an example implementation of a lock-free queue in C++:</p>

        <pre><code class="language-cpp">template &lt;typename T>
class LockFreeQueue {
public:
    LockFreeQueue() : head_(new Node), tail_(head_.load()) {}
    ~LockFreeQueue() {
        T value;
        while (dequeue(value));
        delete head_.load();
    }
    void enqueue(const T& value) {
        Node* node = new Node(value);
        Node* tail = tail_.load();
        do {
            while (tail->next) {
                tail_ = tail = tail->next;
            }
        } while (!tail->next.compare_exchange_weak(nullptr, node));
        tail_ = node;
    }
    bool dequeue(T& value) {
        Node* head = head_.load();
        do {
            if (head == tail_.load()->next) {
                return false;
            }
        } while (!head_.compare_exchange_weak(head, head->next));
        value = head->value;
        delete head;
        return true;
    }
private:
    struct Node {
        T value;
        std::atomic&lt;Node*> next;
        Node(const T& value = T()) : value(value), next(nullptr) {}
        ~Node() {}
    };
    std::atomic&lt;Node*> head_;
    std::atomic&lt;Node*> tail_;
};</code></pre>

        <p>This implementation uses two atomic pointers, head_ and tail_, to keep track of the front and back of the queue. Enqueueing involves creating a new node and adding it to the tail of the queue using a compare-and-swap loop to ensure that no other thread modifies the tail pointer at the same time. Dequeueing involves removing the head of the queue and updating the head pointer in a similar way.</p>

        <p>Lock-free data structures can be more efficient than their lock-based counterparts in highly concurrent environments, but they can also be more complex to implement and reason about. It is important to carefully consider the trade-offs and performance characteristics of different synchronization techniques when designing concurrent data structures.</p>

        <h4>5.5 Parallel Data Structures for GPUs</h4>
        <p>Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) are massively parallel processors that are particularly well-suited for data-parallel workloads, such as matrix multiplication, image processing, and numerical simulations. To efficiently utilize GPUs for parallel algorithms, specialized parallel data structures are often needed, such as GPU-friendly trees, graphs, and hash tables. These data structures are designed to exploit the unique architectural features of GPUs, such as their high memory bandwidth, large register file, and fine-grained parallelism.</p>
        <p>One of the essential characteristics of GPUs is their high memory bandwidth. To exploit this feature, parallel data structures should be designed to minimize the number of memory accesses and maximize data reuse. For instance, a common data structure used in GPU computing is the <b>tiling</b> technique, which partitions data into small blocks that fit into the GPU's cache. This strategy reduces the number of memory accesses and enhances data locality, leading to better performance.</p>
        <p>Another important feature of GPUs is their large register file. Registers are fast, on-chip memory locations that store data used by the GPU's processing cores. To utilize the available register space efficiently, parallel data structures should be designed to minimize register pressure, i.e., the number of registers required to execute a parallel algorithm. A common technique used to reduce register pressure is <b>loop unrolling</b>, which replicates the loop body multiple times to reduce the number of iterations and, consequently, the number of registers required.</p>
        <p>Parallel data structures for GPUs should also take advantage of fine-grained parallelism. GPUs have thousands of processing cores that can execute multiple threads in parallel. However, coordinating these threads can be challenging, and poorly designed data structures can lead to thread divergence and synchronization overhead. To mitigate these issues, parallel data structures should be designed to minimize thread divergence and ensure that threads executing on different cores access memory locations that are far apart. One common technique used to reduce thread divergence is <b>warp-shuffle</b>, which allows threads within a warp to exchange data efficiently.</p>
        <p>Overall, designing efficient parallel data structures for GPUs requires a deep understanding of the GPU's architecture and the characteristics of the target algorithm. However, with careful design and implementation, parallel data structures can significantly enhance the performance of GPU computing applications.</p>

        <p>The above code shows a simple example of how to perform vector addition on a GPU using CUDA, a parallel computing platform and programming model developed by NVIDIA. The <code>vector_add</code> function is a CUDA kernel that is executed in parallel by multiple threads on the GPU. The <code>block_size</code> and <code>grid_size</code> variables determine how the threads are organized into blocks and grids. The kernel adds the corresponding elements of two input arrays and stores the result in an output array.</p>
        <p>Before executing the kernel, the input arrays are allocated on the device using the <code>cudaMalloc</code> function, and their contents are copied from the host to the device using the <code>cudaMemcpy</code> function. After the kernel completes its execution, the output array is copied back from the device to the host, and the result is verified by comparing it with the CPU implementation.</p>
        <p>Although the above example does not use any specialized parallel data structures, it highlights the importance of efficient memory management and thread coordination in GPU computing. Parallel data structures for GPUs can significantly improve the performance of more complex algorithms by minimizing memory accesses, reducing register pressure, and leveraging fine-grained parallelism.</p>
