            <article id="cover-page">
                <h3>2. Cover Page</h3>
                <p>Your practical file should begin with a cover page. This page serves as the face of your document. It should be neatly organized and contain the following information:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Your Name:</strong> Write your full name. This helps in identifying to whom the practical file belongs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Your Student ID:</strong> This is usually a unique number (roll no.) assigned by your institution.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Course Name:</strong> Write the name of the course i.e., 'Data Structures and Algorithms'.</li>
                    <li><strong>Institution Name:</strong> Write the name of your college or university.</li>
                    <li><strong>Professor's Name:</strong> Include the name of your professor who's teaching you the course. It shows respect and also helps in identifying the course instructor.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>

            <article id="table-of-contents">
                <h3>3. Table of Contents</h3>
                <p>After the cover page, include a table of contents. This is like a roadmap of your practical file. It helps in quickly navigating to different sections of the file. It should list all your experiments, their page numbers, and dates. Update it as you add new experiments.</p>
            </article>

            <article id="left-page">
                <h3>4. Left Page (Blank Page)</h3>
                <p>On the left page of your practical file, you need to focus on visualizing your experiment. <mark><strong>This needs to be written by pencil.</mark></strong> This includes the following:</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h4>4.1 Flowchart</h4>
                <p>Graphically represent your algorithm or the process you're implementing. A flowchart is a diagrammatic representation of an algorithm. It uses different shapes to denote different types of instructions. These shapes are connected by arrows to show the flow of control. A well-drawn flowchart can often be easier to understand than the textual description of an algorithm, especially for complex algorithms.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h4>4.2 Dry Run</h4>
                <p>A dry run is a process of carefully working through an algorithm manually, step by step, to see what it does. It's often done using a specific set of inputs. During a dry run, you track the values of variables and the flow of control to understand how the algorithm works. This can help you to verify your algorithm before you write code and also to debug your code if it's not working as expected. In your practical file, write down the steps and the state of all variables at each step.</p>

            <article id="right-page">
                <h3>5. Right Page (Lined Page)</h3>
                <p>On the right page, include:</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h4>5.1 Objective</h4>
                <p>State what you aim to learn or achieve with this exercise. The objective gives direction to your experiment. It helps in understanding why you're performing the experiment and what you're hoping to learn from it.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h4>5.2 Code</h4>
                <p>Include the actual code you used in the experiment. The code is the implementation of your algorithm. When writing your code in the practical file, remember to annotate it for clarity. Add comments to explain what each part of the code does. This not only makes your code easier to understand for others but also for you when you revisit it in the future. Here's an example of how you might format your code:</p>
                <pre><code class="language-cpp">// This is a simple program in C++ that prints "Hello World!" to the console
#include &lt;iostream>
int main() {
    // Print "Hello World!"
    std::cout << "Hello World!";
    // End the program
    return 0;
}</code></pre>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h4>5.3 Results/Output</h4>
                <p>Include the output of your code if applicable. This might be a printed data structure, the result of a sorting algorithm, etc. Write the exact output from your program. This serves as a proof that your code works as expected.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h4>5.4 Discussion</h4>
                <p>Discuss the results of the experiment. Here, you reflect on your work. Did everything work as expected? Were there any issues? What did you learn from this experiment? This is your opportunity to demonstrate your understanding of the experiment.</p>
            </article>

            <article id="end-of-the-file">
                <h3>6. End of the File</h3>
                <p>At the end of the practical file, you might include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Glossary of Key Terms:</strong> A glossary is a list of terms in a particular domain of knowledge with the definitions for those terms. In the context of a practical file, it's a list of key terms related to data structures and algorithms.</li>
                    <li><strong>Index:</strong> An index is an alphabetized list of terms and topics that are discussed in the document, along with the pages that they appear on.</li>
                    <li><strong>Appendices:</strong> If there's any additional information that's too lengthy to include in the body of the document, you can include it in an appendix at the end of the file. For example, if you have a large piece of code or a lengthy mathematical proof, you can include it in an appendix.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>

            <article id="ethics-and-general-instructions">
                <h3>7. Ethics and General Instructions</h3>
                <p>As you work on your practical file, it's important to keep in mind certain ethical guidelines and general instructions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Honesty:</strong> Only include work that you have done yourself. Plagiarism is not acceptable and defeats the purpose of the practical file. It also doesn't help you learn. The purpose of the practical file is to help you learn, and you only learn when you do the work yourself.</li>
                    <li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> Be careful and precise in your work. This includes your code, your descriptions, and the formatting of your file. Errors can lead to incorrect conclusions and can make it harder for others (and for you) to understand your work.</li>
                    <li><strong>Clarity:</strong> Make your file easy to read and understand. Use clear language, label your diagrams, and annotate your code. This makes your work more professional and easier to follow.</li>
                    <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> Follow the same format for each experiment. This makes your file more professional and easier to follow.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Lastly, remember that your practical file is not just atask to be completed for your course; it's a record of your learning process. Treat it as a tool for learning and reflection, not just documentation. Good luck with your studies in Data Structures and Algorithms!</p>
