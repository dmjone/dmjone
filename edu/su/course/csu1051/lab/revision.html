                <h3>Pre-Introduction and Historical Development</h3>

                <p>Data Structures and Algorithms are fundamental concepts in computer science that guide us to write efficient and optimized code. These concepts were developed over time, each with their own purposes and improvements over their predecessors. Let's take a look at the historical development and reasons behind the creation of the core data structures and algorithms in our syllabus:</p>

                <article id="history-arrays">
                    <h4>1. Arrays</h4>
                    <p>The concept of Arrays is as old as programming itself. When programming was done using Assembly language in the early days, Arrays were used as a contiguous block of memory used to store multiple values. They are simple and offer direct access to data.</p>
                </article>

                <article id="history-stacks">
                    <h4>2. Stacks</h4>
                    <p>Stacks were also developed early in the history of computing, being used in the evaluation of arithmetic expressions and syntax parsing. They were used for reversing the order of things and providing simple memory management.</p>
                </article>

                <article id="history-queues">
                    <h4>3. Queues</h4>
                    <p>Queues were developed soon after Stacks, providing a mechanism for fairness, ensuring that items that arrived first were processed first (FIFO).</p>
                </article>

                <article id="history-binary-trees">
                    <h4>4. Binary Trees</h4>
                    <p>Binary Trees were developed to organize data in a hierarchical and ordered manner. They were used in various applications like expression parsing and Huffman encoding.</p>
                </article>

                <article id="history-binary-search-trees">
                    <h4>5. Binary Search Trees</h4>
                    <p>Binary Search Trees (BSTs) were developed as an improvement over Binary Trees, providing efficient searching, insertion, and deletion. In BSTs, the left child node is always less than the parent node, and the right child node is always greater.</p>
                </article>

                <article id="history-avl-trees">
                    <h4>6. AVL Trees</h4>
                    <p>As the need for speed became more crucial, AVL Trees were developed from BSTs to maintain balance, ensuring faster operations. AVL Trees introduced the concept of self-balancing, where the difference of heights of left and right subtrees of any node is not more than one.</p>
                </article>

                <article id="history-b-trees">
                    <h4>7. B-Trees</h4>
                    <p>B-Trees were developed for efficient disk access in databases. Each node in a B-Tree contains multiple keys and can have more than two children, which increases efficiency for large data sets.</p>
                </article>

                <article id="history-b-plus-trees">
                    <h4>8. B+ Trees</h4>
                    <p>B+ Trees were an improvement over B-Trees, primarily used in database systems for efficient disk access. In B+ Trees, all keys are stored in the leaf nodes, which makes range queries faster.</p>

                <article id="history-dijkstra">
                    <h4>9. Dijkstra's Algorithm</h4>
                    <p>With the increasing complexity and size of data, efficient path-finding algorithms became necessary. Dijkstra's algorithm was one of the first algorithms to find the shortest path in a graph with positive weights.</p>
                </article>

                <article id="history-bellmanford">
                    <h4>10. Bellman Ford Algorithm</h4>
                    <p>The Bellman Ford Algorithm was developed as a more versatile but slower alternative to Dijkstra's Algorithm. It can handle graphs with negative edge weights and is used to detect negative cycles in a graph.</p>

                <h3>3. Linked List</h3>
                <p>A Linked List is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object, known as a node, and each node contains a pointer to the next node in the list.</p>

                <h4>3.1 Advantages</h4>
                <p>
                <ul>

                <p>A B+ tree is an n-ary tree with a variable but often large number of children per node. It is a type of tree which represents sorted data in a way that allows for efficient insertion, retrieval and removal of records, each of which is identified by a key. It is a dynamic, multilevel index, with maximum and minimum bounds on the number of keys in the nodes.</p>

                    <h4>1. Difference Between Array, Stack, and Queue</h4>
                    <p>An array is a basic data structure that stores elements of the same type, while a stack and a queue are abstract data types that can be implemented using arrays or linked lists. A stack follows the LIFO (Last In First Out) principle, meaning that the last element inserted is the first one to get out. On the other hand, a queue follows the FIFO (First In First Out) principle, meaning the first element inserted is the first one to get out.</p>

                    <p>A Binary Tree is a tree data structure where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a special case of a Binary Tree where the data elements of each node are in order, so that for each node, all elements in the left subtree are less to the node and all elements in the right subtree are greater than the node.</p>

                    <h4>3. Difference Between BST and AVL Tree</h4>
                    <p>A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a tree in which all the nodes follow the property that they are larger than all the nodes in their left sub-tree and smaller than all the nodes in their right sub-tree. However, BSTs can become unbalanced with multiple insertions and deletions, which can make search operations slower. An AVL Tree, named after its inventors Adelson-Velsky and Landis, is a self-balancing binary search tree. In an AVL tree, the difference of heights of left and right subtrees for any node is less than or equal to one, ensuring it remains balanced and search operations remain faster.</p>

                    <p>B-Tree and B+Tree are both self-balancing tree data structures that maintain sorted data and are commonly used for database indexes and filesystems. B-Tree store data at both leaf and internal nodes, whereas B+Tree stores data only at leaf nodes, with internal nodes only used for distribution purposes. This makes B+Tree more efficient for large data and range queries.</p>

                    <p>Both Dijkstra's Algorithm and the Bellman Ford Algorithm are used to find the shortest path in a graph, but they differ in how they handle edge weights. Dijkstra's Algorithm performs better with positive edge weights but fails in the case of negative edge weights. On the other hand, Bellman Ford's Algorithm can handle negative edge weights and is capable of detecting negative cycles in the graph.</p>
