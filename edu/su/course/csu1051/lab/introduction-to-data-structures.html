                <h3>What is data?</h3>
                <p>Data is raw, unprocessed information that can be quantitative or qualitative, collected for analysis and decision-making. Example: 8823 4323 4333, Graham Bell.</p>
                <p>
                    Data refers to any collection of raw, unprocessed facts, figures, statistics, or other details that can be used to conclude, make decisions, or solve problems. In its simplest form, data can be represented as a series of binary digits (0s and 1s), which can be interpreted and manipulated by computers and other digital devices. Data can take many forms, including text, images, audio, video, and sensor readings.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Data is often categorized into two main types: structured and unstructured data. Structured data is organized in a specific way and can be easily analyzed using mathematical and statistical methods. Examples of structured data include financial records, inventory databases, and customer information. Unstructured data, on the other hand, needs to be organized in a specific way and can be more challenging to analyze. Examples of unstructured data include social media posts, emails, and video recordings.
                </p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h3>What is information</h3>
                <p>Information is processed, organized, or structured data that is meaningful and useful to the user. Eg: Aadhar number: 8823 4323 4333, Name: Graham Bell</p>
                <p>
                    Information is the meaning that is derived from data. It results from analyzing, interpreting, and organizing data to make it meaningful and valuable for a specific purpose or context. Information can take many forms, including knowledge, insights, trends, patterns, and predictions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In order to turn data into information, it must be processed, organized, and analyzed using various methods and techniques. This can involve using statistical models, machine learning algorithms, data visualization tools, or other approaches. This process aims to extract meaningful insights and knowledge from the raw data and present it in a way that is easily understandable and useful for decision-making.

                <h3>What is Database</h3>
                <p>A database is a structured set of data, stored electronically in a computer system, that can be managed, accessed, and updated efficiently. Example: Illustrate using collection of data in multiple tables collectively forms 1 database.</p>
                <p>
                    A database is a structured collection of data stored in a computer or other digital device. It is designed for efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation and can be used for various applications and purposes. Databases can be categorized into different types based on their structure and functionality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The most common type of database is a relational database, which organizes data into tables with defined relationships between them. Each table contains a set of related data, with each row representing a single record and each column representing a. specific attribute or information. Relational databases use a standardized language called SQL (Structured Query Language) to manipulate and query data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Other types of databases include NoSQL databases, designed to handle unstructured or semi-structured data, and graph databases, which represent complex networks of relationships between data points.
                </p>

                <h3>What is Big Data</h3>
                <p>Big data refers to extremely large data sets, often from diverse sources, that may be analyzed computationally to reveal patterns, trends, and associations. Example: Illustrate using collection of thousands of databases collectively is known as Big Data</p>
                <p>
                    Big data refers to enormous and complex datasets that cannot be easily processed or analyzed using traditional methods and tools. It is characterized by the "three Vs.": volume, velocity, and variety. Volume refers to the sheer amount of data that is being generated and collected, ranging from terabytes to petabytes or more. Velocity refers to the speed at which data is generated and processed can be very high in real-time or streaming applications. Variety refers to the many different types and formats of data that are being collected, including structured, unstructured, and semi-structured data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Big data requires specialized tools and technologies to store, process, and analyze it effectively. These can include distributed file systems, such as Hadoop, and distributed computing frameworks, such as Spark, as well as machine learning and data visualization tools. Big data is used in various applications, including business intelligence, scientific research, healthcare, and more.

                <h3>What is Warehouse</h3>
                <p>A warehouse, in the context of data, is a large, centralized repository of data collected from various sources, used for reporting and data analysis. Example: Illustrate using collection of thousands of big data to form 1 warehouse.</p>
                <p>
                    In computing, a warehouse refers to a large repository or collection of data used for analysis, reporting, and decision-making. It supports business intelligence and data analytics by providing centralized data storage and location. A data warehouse is typically optimized for fast query processing and analysis and may contain historical and current data. A data warehouse, or enterprise data warehouse (EDW), is a system that aggregates data from different sources into a single, central, consistent data store to support data analysis, data mining, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning. A data warehouse system enables an organization to run powerful analytics on huge volumes (petabytes and petabytes) of historical data in ways that a standard database cannot. It is a type of data management system that is designed to enable and support business intelligence (BI) activities, especially analytics.

                <h3>What are the types of Data Structure</h3>
                <p>
                    There are many different types of data structures, including:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Arrays</strong>: a collection of data elements that are organized linearly
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Linked lists</strong>: a collection of data elements that are connected through pointers or references
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Stacks</strong>: a data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle, where the most recently added item is the first one to be removed
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Queues</strong>: a data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle, where the first item added is the first one to be removed
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Trees</strong>: a hierarchical data structure where each node has a parent and zero or more children
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Graphs</strong>: a collection of nodes (vertices) and edges that connect them, allowing for complex relationships between data elements
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h3>What is the Importance of the algorithm?</h3>
                <p>
                    Algorithms are essential for several reasons:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Efficiency</strong>: Algorithms provide a way to solve problems quickly and efficiently, which is crucial in many applications.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Standardization</strong>: Many algorithms are widely used and well-understood, allowing developers to rely on established conventions and practices.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Modularity and abstraction</strong>: Algorithms allow for creating modular and abstract code, which is easier to maintain and modify over time.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Correctness</strong>: Well-designed algorithms ensure that problems are solved correctly, reducing the risk of errors or bugs in software.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Performance optimization</strong>: Algorithms can be optimized to run faster or use fewer resources, which can be critical in applications where performance is essential.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>What are the differences between Data Structure and algorithms.</h3>
                <p>
                    Here are five differences between data structures and algorithms:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Data structures organize and store data, while algorithms process and manipulate data.</li>
                    <li>
                        Data structures are concerned with the organization and layout of data, while Algorithms are concerned with the steps and logic required to perform a particular task.</li>
                    <li>
                        Data structures are often defined by their implementation details, such as an array's size or a linked list's structure. In contrast, algorithms are defined by their high-level logic and functionality.</li>
                    <li>
                        Data structures can be used to implement algorithms. However, algorithms do not necessarily depend on specific data structures.</li>
                    <li>
                        Data structures are typically designed to optimize data storage and retrieval. In contrast, algorithms are designed to optimize processing speed and efficiency.</li>
                </ol>
                </p>
