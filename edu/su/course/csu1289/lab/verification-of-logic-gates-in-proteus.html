        <h3>Introduction to Logic Gates</h3>
        <p>
          Imagine you want to create a machine that can make decisions based on certain conditions. To solve this problem, we can use logic gates, which help machines understand what to do in different situations. These gates can be combined to form more complex decision-making systems, enabling us to build various devices like calculators, computers, and even self-driving cars.
        </p>
        <p>
          A logic gate is like a simple question with a "yes" or "no" answer. For example, "Is it raining?" can be answered with "yes" (1) or "no" (0). Envision logic gates as the digital world's magical puzzle pieces that come together to form the complex circuits powering our everyday electronic devices. These gates operate with binary inputs, 0 or 1, and create an output based on the specific combination of input values. In a machine, a logic gate takes two inputs (0 or 1) and gives an output (also 0 or 1) based on the inputs. By combining different types of logic gates, such as AND, OR, NOT etc. machines can make more complex decisions.
        </p>
        <p>
          To better understand logic gates, we can learn about Boolean algebra, a type of math that deals with true (1) and false (0) values. This helps us design and optimize digital systems using logic gates, forming the basis for advanced digital systems like microprocessors and memory devices.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once we grasp the fundamentals of logic gates, we can explore the complexities of creating digital circuits, such as combinational and sequential circuits. This knowledge opens the door to cutting-edge fields like Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) design, quantum computing, and novel computing architectures.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the next section, we will learn how to practically verify the workings of logic gates using Proteus software, an amazing platform for simulating electronic circuits and bringing them to life. This hands-on activity will provide a deeper understanding of logic gates and their functions, allowing you to appreciate their crucial role in the world of digital systems.
        </p>
        <h4>Types of Logic Gates and IC Numbers</h4>
        <p>Let's examine the seven main types of logic gates, their corresponding integrated circuit (IC) numbers, and their characteristics:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>AND gate (IC 7408): Outputs 1 only when both inputs are 1. It uses a two-input AND operation, symbolized as A ⋅ B. AND gates can be cascaded to create multi-input AND gates.</li>
          <li>OR gate (IC 7432): Outputs 1 when at least one input is 1. It uses a two-input OR operation, represented as A + B. OR gates can also be cascaded for multi-input functionality.</li>
          <li>NOT gate (IC 7404): Inverts the input, turning 1 into 0 and vice versa. It uses a single-input NOT operation, denoted as ¬A or A̅. NOT gates are often combined with other gates to create complex operations.</li>
          <li>NAND gate (IC 7400): A combination of AND and NOT gates, outputs 0 only when both inputs are 1. It uses a two-input NAND operation, symbolized as A ⋅ B with an overbar. NAND gates are universal, meaning they can be combined to form any other gate.</li>
          <li>NOR gate (IC 7402): A combination of OR and NOT gates, outputs 1 only when both inputs are 0. It uses a two-input NOR operation, represented as A + B with an overbar. Like NAND gates, NOR gates are also universal.</li>
          <li>XOR gate (IC 74LS86): Outputs 1 when inputs are different and 0 when they are the same. It uses a two-input XOR operation, denoted as A ⊕ B. XOR gates are widely used in error detection and correction circuits.</li>
          <li>XNOR gate (IC 4077): The opposite of XOR, outputs 1 when inputs are the same and 0 when they are different. It uses a two-input XNOR operation, symbolized as A ⊕ B with an overbar. XNOR gates play a key role in parity checkers and adder circuits.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Requirements</strong>: Computer (Windows OS recommended), Proteus software</p>

        <h5>Proteus Setup and General Direction</h5>
        <p>To start exploring logic gates using Proteus, follow these simple steps:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Open the Proteus software.</li>
          <li>Create a new project.</li>
          <li>Add the IC for the desired logic gate to the design.</li>
          <li>Connect input and output pins to switches and LED indicators, respectively.</li>
          <li>Run the simulation and test the truth table by toggling the switches.</li>

        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>In this series of experiments, we have successfully verified the truth tables of AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, and XNOR logic gates using Proteus software. The observed results match the expected truth tables, which validates the functionality of these gates in Proteus software. This provides students with an effective way to learn and understand the behavior of various logic gates and to develop their skills in digital circuit design and simulation.</p>
