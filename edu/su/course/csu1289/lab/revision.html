          <li>
            <h4>What is a Clock Pulse and why is it important in JK Flip Flops?</h4>
            <p>A Clock Pulse is an oscillating signal used to synchronize the operations of digital circuits. In JK Flip Flops, the clock pulse is essential as it controls when the flip flop should react to the inputs. The outputs change state only on the edge (rising or falling) of the clock pulse.</p>

          </li>

            <h4>How can JK Flip Flops be used in counters?</h4>
            <p>JK Flip Flops can be used to design counters by connecting the output of one flip flop as the clock input to the next flip flop. By properly setting the J and K inputs, it is possible to create counters that increment or decrement with each clock pulse.</p>

          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>What is the significance of the Master-Slave configuration in JK Flip Flops?</h4>
            <p>The Master-Slave configuration in JK Flip Flops is used to avoid the race-around condition. In this configuration, the Master Flip Flop responds to the input values when the clock is high, while the Slave Flip Flop responds when the clock is low. This ensures that the output changes only once during a single clock cycle.</p>

            <h4>What is a subtractor in digital electronics?</h4>
            <p>A subtractor is an electronic device that carries out the arithmetic operation of subtraction on binary numbers. It is fundamental in ensuring that digital systems can execute tasks rapidly and effectively. Subtractors are integral components in computers and other digital systems as they form the basis for more complex arithmetic operations</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>What are the two main types of subtractors?</h4>
            <p>The two main types of subtractors are the Half Subtractor and the Full Subtractor. The Half Subtractor is designed to subtract two single-bit binary numbers, while the Full Subtractor subtracts two single-bit binary numbers and also considers a borrow-in bit from a previous subtraction. Both serve as fundamental building blocks for digital circuits and are used for multi-bit binary subtraction</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>What is the role of logic gates in a subtractor?</h4>
            <p>Logic gates such as AND, OR, XOR, and NOT gates are the simpler building blocks that compose Half Subtractors and Full Subtractors. These gates work in a specific sequence to execute binary subtraction and generate the appropriate difference and borrow outputs. Understanding the arrangement and functioning of these logic gates is vital for exploiting the potential of subtractors in digital systems</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>What are the applications of subtractors in digital systems?</h4>
            <p>Subtractors are crucial in various applications including arithmetic logic units (ALUs), floating-point units (FPUs), and digital signal processing (DSP) hardware. They are also indispensable in digital systems such as microprocessors and digital signal processors. Subtractors are used to perform efficient computations and handle borrow propagation which is crucial for multi-bit subtraction in digital systems</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>How does a Half Subtractor work?</h4>
            <p>A Half Subtractor performs binary subtraction of two single-bit numbers, producing a difference and a borrow output. It consists of an XOR gate and an AND gate with a NOT gate. The XOR gate computes the difference and the AND gate coupled with the NOT gate computes the borrow. The Boolean expressions for a Half Subtractor are: Difference = A XOR B; Borrow = NOT(A) AND B</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>How does a Full Subtractor work?</h4>
            <p>A Full Subtractor performs binary subtraction of three single-bit numbers including a borrow-in bit from a previous subtraction. It consists of two XOR gates, two AND gates, an OR gate, and a NOT gate. The Boolean expressions for a Full Subtractor are: Difference = A XOR B XOR Bin; Borrow-out = (NOT(A) AND B) OR (Bin AND (A XOR B)). This setup enables the Full Subtractor to handle borrow propagation which is crucial for multi-bit subtraction</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>What is Proteus software and how is it used in verifying subtractors?</h4>
            <p>Proteus software is a robust platform designed to simulate electronic circuits. It is used to verify the truth tables of Half Subtractors and Full Subtractors by simulating their circuits and observing the difference and borrow outputs for all possible input combinations. This hands-on activity helps in understanding the essential roles of subtractors in digital systems</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>How do you verify a Half Subtractor using Proteus software?</h4>
            <p>To verify a Half Subtractor using Proteus software, you need to create a new schematic capture, add the necessary gates (XOR, AND, NOT) and tools (Logic State, Logic Probe), connect the components to form a Half Subtractor circuit, run the simulation and observe the Difference and Borrow outputs for input combinations, and verify the simulation results against the expected truth tableof a Half Subtractor.

              <li>Verify the simulation results against the expected truth table of a Half Subtractor</li>

            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>How do you verify a Full Subtractor using Proteus software?</h4>
            <p>To verify a Full Subtractor using Proteus software, you need to create a new schematic capture, add the necessary gates (XOR, AND, OR, NOT) and tools (Logic State, Logic Probe), connect the components to form a Full Subtractor circuit, run the simulation and observe the Difference and Borrow Out outputs for all possible input combinations of A, B, and Borrow In (Bin), and verify the simulation results against the expected truth table of a Full Subtractor. The procedure is as follows:
            <ol>
              <li>Open Proteus, create a new schematic capture.</li>
              <li> Add the 74LS86 XOR gate IC, 7408 AND gate IC, 7432 OR gate IC, 7404 NOT gate IC, Logic State, and Logic Probe (Big) from the pick device menu to the dashboard.</li>
