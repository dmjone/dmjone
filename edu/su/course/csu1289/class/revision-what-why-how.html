      </article>

      <article id="analog-signal">
        <h4>1.1 Analog Signal</h4>
        <p>An analog signal is a type of signal that is continuous in both time and value. It can have any value within a specific range.</p>
        <p><strong>Why?</strong> Analog signals are used in traditional broadcasting services such as radio and television because they can be easily manipulated for transmission.</p>
        <p><strong>How?</strong> Analog signals are transformed into digital signals through a process called digitization or sampling.</p>

        <h3>3. Number Systems</h3>
        <p><a href="/edu/su/course/csu1289/class/number-system">Number systems</a> provide a way for us to represent and work with numbers. The four main number systems in digital electronics are binary, decimal, octal, and hexadecimal. Let us explore them in brief.</p>
      </article>

      <article id="binary-number-system">
        <h4>3.1 Binary Number System</h4>
        <p>The binary number system is a base-2 number system that uses two symbols, 0 and 1, to represent all numbers.</p>
        <p><strong>Why?</strong> Computers and other digital systems use the binary number system because it's easier and cheaper to build systems that can only distinguish between two states.</p>
        <p><strong>How?</strong> Binary numbers are represented as a series of 1's and 0's. Each digit in a binary number represents a power of 2.</p>
        <p><strong>Application:</strong> The binary system is used in almost all modern computing and digital systems.</p>
      </article>

      <article id="decimal-number-system">
        <h4>3.2 Decimal Number System</h4>
        <p>The decimal number system is a base-10 number system that uses ten symbols, 0-9, to represent numbers.</p>

        <p><strong>How?</strong> Each digit in an octal number represents a power of 8.</p>
        <p><strong>Application:</strong> It is mostly used in computing systems from the past. It is less used today.</p>
      </article>

      <article id="hexadecimal-number-system">
        <h4>3.4 Hexadecimal Number System</h4>
        <p>The hexadecimal number system is a base-16 number system that uses 16 symbols: 0-9 and A-F.</p>
        <p><strong>Why?</strong> It's often used in computing because it can represent a byte (8 bits) with just two digits, making it more readable than binary.</p>
        <p><strong>How?</strong> Each digit in a hexadecimal number represents a power of 16.</p>
        <p><strong>Application:</strong> Hexadecimal is widely used in computing for memory addressing, color codes, and debugging.</p>
      </article>

      <article id="number-system-conversion">
        <h5>3.5 Number System Conversions</h5>
        <p>Conversion between number systems involves changing the base of the number. Here are the methods to convert between different number systems:</p>
        <p><strong>Binary to Decimal:</strong> Multiply each bit by 2 raised to the power of its position number (from right to left starting from 0), and add the results.</p>
        <p><strong>Decimal to Binary:</strong> Divide the decimal number by 2 and note down the remainder. Repeat the process with the quotient, until the quotient is zero. The binary number will be the remainders in reverse order.</p>
        <p><strong>Binary to Octal:</strong> Group the binary number into sets of three (from right to left), and replace each group with its corresponding octal number.</p>
        <p><strong>Octal to Binary:</strong> Replace each octal digit with its corresponding 3-bit binary number.</p>
        <p><strong>Binary to Hexadecimal:</strong> Group the binary number into sets of four (from right to left), and replace each group with its corresponding hexadecimal digit.</p>

        <h4>7.2 Demultiplexer</h4>
        <p>A demultiplexer (DEMUX) is a device that has one input and multiple outputs. It is used to route the input to one of its outputs based on the states of its select lines.</p>
        <p><strong>Why?</strong> Demultiplexers are used to direct a signal to one of many devices.</p>
        <p><strong>How?</strong> A demultiplexer is constructed from several AND and NOT gates.</p>
        <p><strong>Application:</strong> They are commonly used in data distribution applications such as sharing a single line of a multi-line bus, or routing signals to different devices.</p>

        <h3>8. Encoders and Decoders</h3>
        <p>Encoders and decoders are combinational circuits used for data transformation.</p>
      </article>

      <article id="encoder">
        <h4>8.1 Encoder</h4>
        <p>An encoder is a device that converts multiple input lines into a binary code at the output line.</p>
        <p><strong>Why?</strong> Encoders are used to reduce the number of bits needed to represent a quantity of data.</p>
        <p><strong>How?</strong> An encoder has 2^n (or fewer) input lines and n output lines.</p>
        <p><strong>Application:</strong> They are commonly used in digital systems where data needs to be compressed for storage or transmission.</p>

      <article id="decoder">
        <h4>8.2 Decoder</h4>
        <p>A decoder is a device that does the reverse operation of an encoder. It converts the binary code data at its input into a number of outputs.</p>
        <p><strong>Why?</strong> Decoders are used to convert binary data into a form that can be understood by other devices.</p>
        <p><strong>How?</strong> A decoder has n input lines and 2^n (or fewer) output lines.</p>
        <p><strong>Application:</strong> They are commonly used in digital systems to facilitate compatibility between different types of data and systems.</p>

        <h3>9. Combinational and Sequential Circuits</h3>
        <p>These are two categories of digital circuits, with different characteristics and uses.</p>
      </article>

      <article id="combinational-circuits">
        <h4>9.1 Combinational Circuits</h4>
        <p>Combinational circuits are a type of digital circuit where the output depends only on the current state of the inputs. They have no memory.</p>
        <p><strong>Why?</strong> These are used for functions where the output is a direct function of the input without any need for memory.</p>
        <p><strong>How?</strong> In these circuits, the output is determined by applying Boolean logic to the inputs.</p>
        <p><strong>Application:</strong> Logic gates, multiplexers, encoders, and decoders are examples of combinational circuits.</p>
      </article>

      <article id="sequential-circuits">
        <h4>9.2 Sequential Circuits</h4>
        <p>Sequential circuits are a type of digital circuit where the output depends on the current state of the inputs as well as previous states, i.e., they have memory.</p>
        <p><strong>Why?</strong> These are used for functions where the output depends not only on the current input but also on a series of past inputs.</p>
        <p><strong>How?</strong> These circuits use storage elements like flip-flops along with logic gates.</p>
        <p><strong>Application:</strong> Counters, registers, and memory units are examples of sequential circuits.</p>
