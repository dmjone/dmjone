        <h3>1. Introduction to Time Division Multiplexing (TDM)</h3>
        <p>Imagine a situation where you need to hold a video conference with multiple team members from different parts of the world. To facilitate this, you have a single communication channel at your disposal. How will you ensure that every team member can speak and be heard without their voices clashing? One way to solve this issue is by employing Time Division Multiplexing (TDM). </p>
        <p>Now, what exactly is Time Division Multiplexing? In the most fundamental sense, TDM is a method that allows multiple data streams to share a single communication channel. In TDM, each data stream is assigned a particular time slot in a repeating cycle. The transmitting device sends portions of each data stream in its assigned time slot, while the receiving device collects and reassembles the pieces to form the original streams. It's like organizing a round-table discussion where each person speaks in turn, preventing crosstalk.</p>
        <p>TDM can be seen as a time-sharing system where each data stream gets a fraction of the total bandwidth for a certain amount of time. The entire process is rapid and systematic, which makes it seem as if all data streams are being transmitted simultaneously and continuously. This technique is commonly used in telecommunications, digital television broadcasting, and digital audio technologies.</p>

      <article id="tdm-working-principle">
        <h4>1.1 The Working Principle of TDM</h4>
        <p>Having understood the basic concept of TDM, let's delve into its working principles. The first stage in TDM involves separating the entire bandwidth into multiple time slots. Each incoming data stream is then allocated a specific slot, during which it gets exclusive access to the channel. </p>
        <p>The multiplexer, a device that combines several signals into one, takes each input signal in turn based on its slot in the cycle. The input signals are buffered to accommodate the difference in arrival times before being combined into one output. At the receiving end, a demultiplexer separates the incoming signal into the original channels based on the time slots. It's like a relay race where each runner has an exclusive time to run their portion of the race, and the baton being passed represents the transmission channel.</p>

      <article id="tdm-types">
        <h4>1.2 Types of TDM</h4>
        <p>Depending on how data is transmitted, there are two types of TDM: Synchronous TDM and Asynchronous TDM, also known as Statistical TDM.</p>
        <article id="synchronous-tdm">
          <h5>1.2.1 Synchronous TDM</h5>
          <p>Synchronous TDM is the simpler and more traditional form. In this type, the time slots are divided evenly among all the data streams, whether or not they have data to send. This method is efficient when the data streams have a steady flow of data. However, it can lead to inefficiency if some data streams have data to send intermittantly because their time slots can go unused.</p>
        </article>
        <article id="asynchronous-tdm">
          <h5>1.2.2 Asynchronous TDM</h5>
          <p>Asynchronous TDM, on the other hand, dynamically allocates time slots to data streams as needed. This makes it more efficient for handling data streams with variable data rates or intermittent transmission. The time slots in Asynchronous TDM are not fixed; they are assigned on demand. Therefore, no bandwidth is wasted. However, this method is more complex because it requires additional information to be sent with each data piece to identify its source.</p>

      <article id="tdm-advantages-limitations">
        <h4>1.3 Advantages and Limitations of TDM</h4>
        <p>TDM provides an efficient and reliable method for multiple data streams to share a single channel. It simplifies the physical infrastructure required for communication and allows for scalability. However, it also has limitations. In Synchronous TDM, bandwidth can be wasted if all data streams do not have data to send continuously. And while Asynchronous TDM addresses this issue, it does so at the cost of increased complexity.</p>
      </article>
      <article id="tdm-vs-tdma">
        <h4>1.4 TDM vs. TDMA</h4>
        <p>Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) is a communication method that uses TDM to allow multiple users to share the same frequency band in a wireless communication system. While TDM is the fundamental technique that allows for time division, TDMA is the application of this technique in a multiple access scenario where multiple users, not just multiple data streams, are involved.</p>
        <p>In TDMA, each user is assigned a particular time slot during which they can send or receive data. The data from each user is multiplexed and transmitted over the shared frequency band, and then demultiplexed at the receiver. This makes TDMA an efficient and effective method for managing the limited wireless spectrum, as it allows multiple users to share the same frequency without interference.</p>

      <article id="tdm-implementation">
        <h4>1.5 Implementation of TDM in C++</h4>
        <p>Implementing TDM in a programming language like C++ involves the creation of a multiplexer and a demultiplexer. For the sake of simplicity, let's assume that we're working with Synchronous TDM, where we have a fixed number of input channels and each channel has data to transmit at every time slot.</p>
        <pre><code class="language-cpp">#include &lt;iostream>
#include &lt;vector>
#include &lt;queue>
using namespace std;

// Define the number of input channels
#define CHANNELS 4

class TDM {
public:
    // Queues to simulate input channels
    vector &lt;queue &lt;int>> inputChannels;
    
    // Constructor
    TDM() {
        inputChannels.resize(CHANNELS);
    }

    // Simulate data input in channels
    void inputData(int channel, int data) {
        inputChannels[channel].push(data);
    }
    
    // Multiplex the data
    vector &lt;int> multiplex() {
        vector&lt;int> muxData;
        for(int i = 0; i < CHANNELS; i++) {
            if(!inputChannels[i].empty()) {
                muxData.push_back(inputChannels[i].front());
                inputChannels[i].pop();
            }
        }
        return muxData;
    }
};

int main() {
    TDM tdm;
    
    // Input some data
    tdm.inputData(0, 101);
    tdm.inputData(1, 102);
    tdm.inputData(2, 103);
    tdm.inputData(3, 104);
    
    // Multiplex and print the data
    vector &lt;int> muxData = tdm.multiplex();
    for(int data : muxData) {
        cout << data << " ";
    }

    return 0;
}</code></pre>
        <p>In this C++ implementation, we represent each input channel as a queue. We then input some data into these channels and multiplex the data by taking one item from each queue in a round-robin manner, simulating the operation of a TDM system.</p>
