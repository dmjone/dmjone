        <h3>1. The Intricate Puzzle of Digital Decision-Making</h3>
        <p>Imagine you're a conductor of a grand orchestra, with musicians waiting for your signal to play their parts. You give the cue, and they respond, creating a harmonious symphony of sounds. Now, consider a similar scenario, but instead of musicians, you're conducting an orchestra of electrical signals, guiding them to create logical decisions. This is the realm of digital electronics, and the maestros of this domain are the Logic Gates.</p>
        <p>Now, you might wonder, what is a Logic Gate? Well, in the simplest of terms, it's a device that makes decisions based on the inputs it receives. Much like how a conductor decides when the violin or the cello should play, a logic gate determines the output of an electronic circuit based on its input. But instead of musical notes, logic gates deal with binary data - 0s and 1s, the language of computers.</p>
        <p>But as we orchestrate these electrical signals, things get a bit more complex. Let's examine why.</p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h3>2. The Fundamental Gates: NOT, AND, and OR</h3>
        <p>To understand the intricacies of logic gates, we must first get acquainted with the primary gates: NOT, AND, and OR. These are the basic building blocks in the realm of digital electronics.</p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h4>2.1 NOT Gate</h4>
        <p>The NOT gate, also known as an inverter, is the simplest of all logic gates with a single input and a single output. Picture it as a moody teenager who always does the opposite of what you say. If you provide it with a 0, it outputs a 1, and if you give it a 1, it outputs a 0. This 'contrary' nature is the essence of the NOT gate.</p>
        <p>The concept of a NOT gate is similar to negation in mathematics. It's like saying "not true" (false) when a statement is true, and "not false" (true) when a statement is false. It effectively flips the input condition.</p>
        <p>Formally, the NOT gate operation can be defined as:</p>
        <p>$$f(a) = \overline{a}$$</p>
        <p>where 'a' is the input and $\overline{a}$ is the output. If 'a' is 1, then $\overline{a}$ is 0, and if 'a' is 0, then $\overline{a}$ is 1. This is also represented in the truth table below:</p>
        <pre>
A | NOT A
--|------
0 |   1
1 |   0
        </pre>
        <h5>2.1.1 Logical NOT vs Ordinary Subtraction</h5>
        <p>In ordinary subtraction, we subtract one numerical value from another, e.g., 5 minus 3 equals 2. However, the logical NOT operation, which can loosely be compared to subtraction, operates differently. The NOT operation (often written as ~A or !A) inverts the binary input. That is, if the input is 1, the output is 0, and vice versa. This is akin to subtracting a number from 1, where you get the 'opposite' of that number in a binary sense.</p>
        <h5>2.1.2 Importance of NOT Gate</h5>
        <p>The NOT gate is a critical component in digital circuits due to its inverting characteristics. It forms the basis of more complex gates and digital systems. In computer systems, it's used in operations like bitwise complement, where each bit of a binary number is flipped (1 to 0 and 0 to 1), crucial for certain computational tasks.</p>
        <h5>2.1.3 NOT Gate Implementation in C++</h5>
        <pre><code class="language-cpp">// C++ implementation of NOT gate
bool NOT(bool a) {
  return !a;
}</code></pre>
        <p>In this C++ implementation, the NOT function takes a boolean input and returns its negation. The '!' operator is used for the NOT operation in C++.</p>
        <h5>2.1.4 Interesting Facts and Concepts about NOT Gate</h5>
        <p>NOT gates are intriguing for a variety of reasons. Below are some fascinating facts, concepts, and uses of NOT gates that you may find interesting, confusing, and even silly at times, but are actually quite significant in the field of digital electronics.</p>
        <h6>2.1.4.1 The Universal Gate Concept</h6>
        <p>The NOT gate, when combined with either the NAND or the NOR gate, forms what is known as a 'Universal Gate'. Universal Gates can mimic the operation of any other gate type. In other words, any digital circuit can be implemented using only these gate types, which is a fascinating aspect of digital electronics.</p>
        <h6>2.1.4.2 NOT Gate in Memory Storage</h6>
        <p>One might think that a simple gate like the NOT gate wouldn't have much use in complex operations. However, NOT gates are used in the construction of flip-flops, which are the building blocks of digital memory. This highlights the role of NOT gates in memory storage and retrieval.</p>
        <h6>2.1.4.3 NOT Gate and Power Consumption</h6>
        <p>Every time a NOT gate (or any other logic gate) switches states, it consumes power. This might seem obvious, but it's often overlooked. This is why computers generate heat and need to manage power consumption and dissipation effectively. Engineers are always looking for ways to reduce the number of state changes and gate operations to conserve energy.</p>
        <h6>2.1.4.4 The Odd NOT Gate Paradox</h6>
        <p>Here's a thought experiment that might seem silly but is actually an interesting paradox. Imagine you have a NOT gate, and you feed its output back into its input. What would be the output? You might initially think it would constantly flip between 0 and 1, but that's not possible as digital circuits don't operate in continuous time. This kind of circuit, known as an 'oscillator', can actually cause unpredictable behavior in real-world digital systems!</p>
        <h6>2.1.4.5 NOT Gate in Quantum Computing</h6>
        <p>The NOT gate has a quantum analog in quantum computing, known as the Pauli-X gate, which flips the quantum state of a qubit. It's fascinating to see how concepts from classical digital logic also apply in the realm of quantum computing.</p>
        <h6>2.1.4.6 Parity Generator and Checker</h6>
        <p>NOT gates find substantial use in generating and checking parity bits in digital communication. Parity bits are added to data to detect errors during transmission. If we are using even parity, the parity bit is set in such a way that the total number of 1s in the data (including the parity bit) is even. In the case of odd parity, the parity bit is set so that the total number of 1s is odd. If the received data doesn't fulfill the parity condition, we can conclude that an error occurred during transmission.</p>
        <h6>2.1.4.7 NOT Gate in Binary Arithmetic</h6>
        <p>NOT gates are also essential in binary arithmetic, specifically in the operation of two's complement. Two's complement is a method for representing negative binary numbers and is crucial for performing subtraction. It involves inverting the bits of the number (using a NOT gate) and then adding one to the result.</p>
        <h6>2.1.4.8 NOT Gates in Logic Puzzles</h6>
        <p>For the fun side of things, NOT gates (and logic gates in general) are often used in logic puzzles and brain teasers. You might find a puzzle asking you to figure out the output of a complex circuit involving several NOT gates and other logic gates. These puzzles can be a fun way to test your understanding of logic gates and digital logic.</p>
        <h5>2.1.5 More on Technical Implementation</h5>
        <p>When it comes to the implementation of NOT gates in integrated circuits, there are many interesting facts. For instance, in CMOS technology, the NOT function is usually the simplest to implement and has the lowest propagation delay. This is why CMOS inverters are often used as delay elements in digital circuits.</p>
        <p>However, when it comes to actual physical size, a NOT gate in CMOS technology takes up more space than you might expect. This is because it requires both p-type and n-type transistors, and the p-type transistor must be larger due to its lower mobility.</p>
        <p>Also, while the NOT gate is logically the simplest gate, it can be affected by several issues in practical scenarios, such as noise margin problems, power dissipation, and signal integrity issues. These are important considerations in the design of digital circuits and systems.</p>
        <h5>2.1.6 Deep Technical Dive into NOT Gate</h5>
        <p>For those interested in the actual physical implementation of a NOT gate, it's typically constructed using a transistor-transistor logic (TTL) inverter circuit, or a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) inverter circuit. These circuits use transistors to achieve the inversion operation.</p>
        <p>In a TTL inverter, the input signal is applied to the base-emitter junction of a transistor. Depending on whether the input is high (1) or low (0), the transistor switches between cut-off and saturation modes, effectively inverting the input signal.</p>
        <p>In a CMOS inverter, a pair of complementary MOSFETs (p-type and n-type) are used. When the input is high, the n-type MOSFET is ON, and the p-type is OFF, resulting in a low output. When the input is low, the p-type MOSFET is ON, and the n-type is OFF, leading to a high output.</p>
        <h5>2.1.7 NOT Gate: The Cornerstone of Digital Logic</h5>
        <p>As we've seen, the NOT gate, despite its simplicity, is a cornerstone of digital logic. It's not just about flipping 0s and 1s; it's about the fundamental concept of inversion, of turning things around, of questioning the status quo. It's about transforming a YES into a NO, an ON into an OFF, a TRUE into a FALSE. It's a powerful reminder that in the world of digital electronics, as in life, things are not always what they seem. Sometimes, you have to look at the world through an inverter to see things clearly!</p>

        <h3>2.2 AND Gate: The Unyielding Gatekeeper</h3>
        <p>Imagine you're planning a secret club meeting. The rule is simple: the meeting can only happen if both you and your friend are present. This is a problem of coordination and communication, but it's also about logic. This is where the AND gate, a fundamental concept in digital electronics, comes into play.</p>
        <h4>2.2.1 What is an AND Gate?</h4>
        <p>Let's imagine the AND gate as a gatekeeper who allows entry into the secret club meeting only when both you and your friend are there. In digital electronics, an AND gate works similarly. It's a type of logic gate that takes in two signals, and it only outputs a signal when both of its inputs are active. Think of it like a strict parent who needs all conditions met before saying yes.</p>
        <h4>2.2.2 AND Gate: The Basics</h4>
        <p>In the world of binary, where we only have 1s (yes) and 0s (no), the AND gate works by saying 'yes' only when both inputs are 'yes'. If any one or both of the inputs say 'no', then the AND gate also says 'no'. This can be represented by the following mathematical function:</p>
        <p>$f(a, b) = a \land b$</p>
        <p>Here, 'a' and 'b' are the inputs. The output is 1 only if both 'a' and 'b' are 1; otherwise, it's 0.</p>
        <h4>2.2.3 Logical AND vs Ordinary Multiplication</h4>
        <p>As we delve deeper into the AND gate, it's worth distinguishing between logical AND operation and ordinary multiplication. While both operations can be related, they are not the same. Ordinary multiplication operates on numerical values, for example, 3 multiplied by 2 equals 6. However, logical AND operation, often referred to as 'logical multiplication', works on binary values (0 and 1) instead of numerical values. The operation A AND B (often written as A.B or AB) gives an output of 1 only if both A and B are 1. This is analogous to the multiplication operation where, if you multiply any number by zero, the result is zero.</p>
        <h5>2.2.4 Implementation of AND Gate in C++</h5>
        <p>Understanding the conceptual operation of the AND gate is one thing, but how about its practical implementation in programming? For this, we turn to C++, a general-purpose programming language widely used in the realm of digital electronics. Here's a simple function that simulates an AND gate:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-cpp">// C++ implementation of AND gate
bool AND(bool a, bool b) {
  return a && b;
}</code></pre>
        <p>In this code, the function 'AND' takes two boolean inputs 'a' and 'b'. The '&&' operator is a logical AND operator in C++, which returns true if both operands are true.</p>
        <h4>2.2.5 Deep Dive into AND Gate</h4>
        <p>From a higher perspective, the AND gate is a crucial building block in digital electronics and computing. It is a universal gate, meaning you can build any other type of gate using just AND gates and NOT gates. This includes OR gates, XOR gates, NAND gates, NOR gates, and XNOR gates. Furthermore, understanding the operation of the AND gate helps in grasping complex concepts such as Boolean Algebra, Logic Circuits, and even the functioning of computer processors at a fundamental level.</p>
        <h4>2.2.6 The Ubiquity of AND Gates</h4>
        <p>While the AND gate might seem simple, it's a fundamental part of how our digital world works. From controlling the flow of electricity in electronic devices to governing the logical operations in computer systems, AND gates are everywhere. They are one of the reasons why you can read this sentence on your device right now. Realizing this, one can appreciate the depth and importance of this seemingly elementary concept in our digitally dominated world.</p>
        <h4>2.2.7 Further Explorations</h4>
        <p>In the next section, we will embark on an exciting journey with the OR gate, another fundamental gate in digital electronics. Just like the AND gate, the OR gate has its unique set of rules and plays a vital role in shaping the digital world as we know it. It's a thrilling exploration filled with logic, electronics, and a touch of magic. So, stay tuned and keep reading!</p>

        <h3>2.3 OR Gate: The Flexible Logic Gate</h3>
        <p>Imagine you're planning a weekend outing. It will happen if either your friend comes along, or the weather is nice, or both conditions are met. This simple everyday decision-making is an embodiment of the OR logic. To understand how this is applied in the digital world, let's delve into the concept of an OR gate.</p>
        <p>The OR gate, much like the lenient parent in our analogy, is a fundamental element of digital logic that outputs a '1' if at least one of its inputs is '1'. In simpler terms, it's like saying "if either this happens, or that happens, then we're good to go". It only gives a '0' when both conditions are unmet, just like your outing doesn't happen when both your friend doesn't come and the weather isn't nice.</p>

        <h4>2.3.1 OR Gate: The Mathematical Definition</h4>
        <p>Let's take a step forward and formally define the operation of an OR gate. In the language of mathematics, we can express this as:</p>
        <p>$$f(a, b) = a \lor b$$</p>
        <p>Here, 'a' and 'b' are the inputs. The output is '1' if either 'a' or 'b' is '1', or if both are '1'. It's only '0' if both 'a' and 'b' are '0'.</p>
        <h4>2.3.2 Distinguishing Logical OR from Ordinary Addition</h4>
        <p>Now, you might wonder, "Isn't this just like adding numbers?" Not quite. While the OR operation is sometimes referred to as 'logical addition', it differs fundamentally from ordinary numerical addition. Let's explore how.</p>
        <p>In ordinary addition, we add numerical values to get a sum, for instance, 2 plus 3 equals 5. However, the OR operation works with binary values. The operation A OR B (often written as A+B) outputs '1' if either A, B, or both are 1. You can think of this as similar to adding zero to any number, the result is the number itself. Yet, once a '1' is encountered in the OR operation, the output is '1', irrespective of the other inputs. So, unlike numerical addition, '1' plus '1' in logical OR still equals '1'.</p>

        <h4>2.3.3 Implementing the OR Gate in C++</h4>
        <p>Moving deeper into the subject, let's look at how we can implement an OR gate in the C++ programming language:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-cpp">bool OR(bool a, bool b) {
  return a || b;
}</code></pre>
        <p>This function takes two boolean inputs, 'a' and 'b', and returns the result of their logical OR operation. The '||' operator in C++ is the logical OR operator, and it works precisely like our OR gate definition.</p>
        <h4>2.3.4 The Power of OR Gates in Complex Systems</h4>
        <p>At a first glance, the OR gate might seem too straightforward or basic to contribute much to advanced digital systems. But don't let its simplicity deceive you. Much like how a symphony's beauty arises from the harmonious combination of basic notes, complex digital logic systems are built upon these fundamental gates.</p>
        <p>By creatively combining OR gates with other types of gates, such as AND and NOT gates, we can design intricate circuits capable of performing a wide variety of tasks. This is the foundational principle behind the design of computer processors, memory units, and many other digital electronics.</p>
        <h5>2.3.5 Advanced Concepts: Universality of Logic Gates</h5>
        <p>On a more advanced note, the OR gate, along with AND and NOT gates, holds a special status in digital electronics due to a property known as 'functional completeness' or 'universality'. This means that any logical function, no matter how complex, can be implemented using just these types of gates.</p>
        <p>The concept of universality is fundamental to the theory of computation and forms the basis for the construction of programmable computers. So, the humble OR gate is more powerful than it seems, serving as one of the key building blocks of the digital age.</p>
        <p>With this understanding of the OR gate, we've unlocked yet another door to the fascinating world of digital electronics. But our journey doesn't stop here. In the next section, we'll dive into the realm of the NAND gate. Known for its versatility, the NAND gate is a powerful building block in digital logic. We'll explore its unique properties and discover why it plays a crucial role in modern digital systems. Get ready to uncover the secrets of the NAND gate and unlock new possibilities in digital electronics! Stay tuned!</p>

        <!-- In the next section, we'll delve into the intriguing realm of the XOR gate, a 'smart' gate that adds an extra layer of decision-making to our digital logic symphony. It's a step up from the OR gate, and its unique properties make it essential for tasks like error detection and correction in data transmission. -->

        <h3>3. The Art of Combining Logic Gates</h3>
        <p>Just as a seasoned chef combines simple ingredients to create a culinary masterpiece, skilled engineers can combine these basic gates to form more advanced logic gates. These combinations allow us to perform intricate decision-making in our digital systems.</p>

        <h4>3.1 NAND Gate</h4>
        <p>The NAND (NOT-AND) gate is a combination of an AND gate followed by a NOT gate. If the strict AND gate and the contrary NOT gate had a child, it would be the NAND gate. It outputs 0 only when both inputs are 1; for all other input combinations, it outputs 1.</p>
        <p>Formally, the NAND gate operation can be defined as:</p>
        <p>$f(a, b) = \overline{a \land b}$</p>
        <p>where 'a' and 'b' are the inputs, and the overline denotes the NOT operation. The output is 1 unless both 'a' and 'b' are 1.</p>
        <h4>3.1.1 Logical NAND vs Inverse Multiplication</h4>
        <p>Logical NAND operation is the inverse of the logical AND operation. If we think of logical AND as a form of multiplication, then NAND can be loosely compared to taking the reciprocal in multiplication. However, unlike in ordinary multiplication where the reciprocal of a number 'n' is 1/n, NAND operation gives an output of 0 only if both the inputs are 1. For all other combinations, the output is 1. This is akin to saying that if both factors in a multiplication operation are non-zero (i.e., the product is non-zero), the reciprocal is zero.</p>
        <pre><code class="language-cpp">
// C++ implementation of NAND gate
bool NAND(bool a, bool b) {
  return !(a && b);
}
</code></pre>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h4>3.2 NOR Gate</h4>
        <p>The NOR (NOT-OR) gate is an OR gate followed by a NOT gate. It outputs 1 only when both inputs are 0; for all other input combinations, it outputs 0.</p>
        <p>Formally, the NOR gate operation can be defined as:</p>
        <p>$f(a, b) = \overline{a \lor b}$</p>
        <p>where 'a' and 'b' are the inputs. The output is 1 only if both 'a' and 'b' are 0.</p>
        <h5>3.2.1 Logical NOR vs Inverse Addition</h5>
        <p>The logical NOR operation can be seen as the inverse of the logical OR operation. If we consider logical OR as a form of addition, then NOR can be loosely compared to taking the inverse in addition. However, unlike in ordinary addition where the inverse of a sum is the negative of that sum, the NOR operation gives an output of 1 only if both the inputs are 0. For all other combinations, the output is 0. This is akin to saying that if the sum in an addition operation is non-zero, the inverse is zero.</p>
        <pre><code class="language-cpp">
// C++ implementation of NOR gate
bool NOR(bool a, bool b) {
  return !(a || b);
}
</code></pre>
        <p>By combining the basic logic gates, we've created new gates capable of more complex operations. Yet, we can push the envelope even further.</p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h3>4. Introducing Exclusive Gates: XOR and XNOR</h3>
        <p>In our digital orchestra, we now introduce two unique maestros - the XOR (Exclusive OR) and XNOR (Exclusive NOR) gates. These gates, unlike the others, perform exclusive operations, meaning their output depends on the exact combination of their inputs.</p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h4>4.1 XOR Gate</h4>
        <p>The XOR gate is like a digital seesaw. It outputs 1 only when its two inputs are unbalanced, i.e., one is 1 and the other is 0. If the inputs are the same, the output is 0.</p>
        <p>Formally, the XOR gate operation can be defined as:</p>
        <p>$f(a, b) = a \oplus b$</p>
        <p>where 'a' and 'b' are the inputs. The output is 1 if 'a' and 'b' are different (one is 1 and the other is 0); otherwise, it's 0.</p>
        <h5>4.1.1 Logical XOR vs Parity Addition</h5>
        <p>The XOR (exclusive OR) operation can be viewed as a form of 'parity addition'. In ordinary addition, the sum of two numbers is the total value you get when the numbers are added together. However, in the XOR operation, the output is 1 if the number of 1s in the inputs is odd, and the output is 0 if the number of 1s is even. This is similar to parity checking in binary numbers, where we check whether the number of 1s is even (even parity) or odd (odd parity).</p>
        <pre><code class="language-cpp">
// C++ implementation of XOR gate
bool XOR(bool a, bool b) {
    return a ^ b;
}
</code></pre>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h4>4.2 XNOR Gate</h4>
        <p>The XNOR gate, also known as the equivalence gate, is the opposite of the XOR gate. It outputs 1 when its inputs are the same and 0 when they are different.</p>
        <p>Formally, the XNOR gate operation can be defined as:</p>
        <p>$f(a, b) = \overline{a \oplus b}$</p>
        <p>where 'a' and 'b' are the inputs. The output is 1 if 'a' and 'b' are the same; otherwise, it's 0.</p>
        <h5>4.2.1 Logical XNOR vs Equality Comparison</h5>
        <p>The XNOR (exclusive NOR) operation can be compared to an equality comparison operation. It gives an output of 1 if both inputs are the same (both 0 or both 1), and an output of 0 if the inputs are different. This is similar to the equality comparison in mathematics, where the result is 'true' if the compared values are the same, and 'false' otherwise.</p>
        <pre><code class="language-cpp">
// C++ implementation of XNOR gate
bool XNOR(bool a, bool b) {
    return !(a ^ b);
}
</code></pre>
        <p>With the XOR and XNOR gates, our digital symphony has gained even more depth, enabling a wider range of logical expressions and decision-making capabilities.</p>

        <h3>5. Universal Gates: NAND and NOR</h3>
        <p>Now, let's delve deeper into the fascinating world of logic gates. You might be wondering, with all these different gates, do we need all of them for our digital systems? Here comes an intriguing fact: we can construct any logic function using just NAND gates or just NOR gates. This ability makes them "universal gates".</p>
        <h4>5.1 Universality of NAND Gate</h4>
        <p>Yes, it's true. The NAND gate alone can mimic the behavior of all other gates. Let's see how.</p>
        <p>From the definition of the NAND gate, we know that if both inputs are 1, the output is 0; otherwise, it's 1. Now, if we make both inputs the same, say 'a', the NAND gate becomes a NOT gate because:</p>
        <p>$\overline{a \land a} = \overline{a}$</p>
        <p>Also, by combining NAND gates, we can create the AND and OR gates. The AND operation can be recreated by applying the De Morgan's law, and the OR operation can be achieved by creating a NOT-AND (NAND) structure.</p>
        <pre><code class="language-cpp">
// C++ implementation of AND gate using NAND gates
bool AND_using_NAND(bool a, bool b) {
    bool nand = !(a && b); // NAND operation
    return !(nand); // Double negation gives the AND operation
}

// C++ implementation of OR gate using NAND gates
bool OR_using_NAND(bool a, bool b) {
    bool nand1 = !(a && a); // acts as NOT gate
    bool nand2 = !(b && b); // acts as NOT gate
    return !(nand1 && nand2); // NAND operation of the negated inputs gives the OR operation
}
</code></pre>
        <h4>5.2 Universality of NOR Gate</h4>
        <p>Just as the NAND gate, the NOR gate is also a universal gate. It can emulate the behavior of all other gates.</p>
        <p>If we make both inputs the same, say 'a', the NOR gate becomes a NOT gate because:</p>
        <p>$\overline{a \lor a} = \overline{a}$</p>
        <p>By combining NOR gates, we can create the AND and OR gates. The AND operation can be achieved by creating a NOT-OR (NOR) structure, and the OR operation can be recreated by applying the De Morgan's law.</p>
        <pre><code class="language-cpp">
// C++ implementation of AND gate using NOR gates
bool AND_using_NOR(bool a, bool b) {
    bool nor1 = !(a || a); // acts as NOT gate
    bool nor2 = !(b || b); // acts as NOT gate
    return !(nor1 || nor2); // NOR operation of the negated inputs gives the AND operation
}

// C++ implementation of OR gate using NOR gates
bool OR_using_NOR(bool a, bool b) {
    bool nor = !(a || b); // NOR operation
    return !(nor); // Double negation gives the OR operation
}
</code></pre>
        <p>The universality of NAND and NOR gates has profound implications for digital electronics, enabling the construction of complex logical circuits with a single type of gate. This is similar to how a solo instrument can play an entire melody.</p>

        <h3>7. Easy Way to Learn Truth Tables</h3>
        <p>Understanding the truth tables of logic gates is a fundamental step towards mastering digital electronics. But with seven different gates, it can seem overwhelming. Here's an easy way to remember all of them:</p>
        <h4>7.1 Basic Gates: AND, OR, NOT</h4>
        <p>Start with the basic gates. The AND gate is like a strict parent: both inputs must be 1 for the output to be 1. The OR gate is more lenient: if either input is 1, the output is 1. The NOT gate is contrary: it simply inverts the input.</p>
        <h4>7.2 NAND and NOR Gates</h4>
        <p>The NAND and NOR gates are just the inverters of AND and OR gates, respectively. Think of them as the NOT gate applied to AND and OR. So, for NAND, only when both inputs are 1, the output is 0. For NOR, if any input is 1, the output is 0.</p>
        <h4>7.3 XOR and XNOR Gates</h4>
        <p>The XOR (Exclusive OR) gate is like a decision-maker: it gives 1 when the inputs differ. The XNOR (Exclusive NOR) gate, as the name suggests, is the inverse of XOR: it gives 1 when the inputs are the same.</p>
        <p>So, for XOR, think "different" (01 or 10), and for XNOR, think "same" (00 or 11).</p>
        <p>Here are the truth tables for reference:</p>
        <p>AND Gate:</p>
        <pre>
A B | Output
0 0 |   0
0 1 |   0
1 0 |   0
1 1 |   1
</pre>
        <p>OR Gate:</p>
        <pre>
A B | Output
0 0 |   0
0 1 |   1
1 0 |   1
1 1 |   1
</pre>
        <p>NOT Gate:</p>
        <pre>

0 |   1
1 |   0
</pre>
        <p>NAND Gate:</p>
        <pre>
A B | Output
0 0 |   1
0 1 |   1
1 0 |   1
1 1 |   0
</pre>
        <p>NOR Gate:</p>
        <pre>
A B | Output
0 0 |   1
0 1 |   0
1 0 |   0
1 1 |   0
</pre>
        <p>XOR Gate:</p>
        <pre>
A B | Output
0 0 |   0
0 1 |   1
1 0 |   1
1 1 |   0
</pre>
        <p>XNOR Gate:</p>
        <pre>
A B | Output
0 0 |   1
0 1 |   0
1 0 |   0
1 1 |   1
</pre>
        <p>Practice is the key. Try to sketch these tables without looking at them. With consistent practice, you'll find yourself remembering these tables with ease.</p>
