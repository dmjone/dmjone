        <h3>1. Introduction to Demultiplexers</h3>
        <p>Imagine you're a high school student working on a science project where you've to control several LEDs using a single input. You quickly realize that using a separate pin for each LED is impractical due to the limited number of pins available on your microcontroller. The problem of controlling multiple devices using a single input line is quite common in digital electronics. Here is where a demultiplexer, also known as a "demux," comes into the picture.</p>
        <p>At its core, a demultiplexer is a device that takes a single input line and routes it to one of several digital output circuits. It is a crucial component in digital electronics and communication systems, including computer memory and data routing technologies. The purpose of the demultiplexer is to allow a single data line to create multiple outputs by selecting the output line to which the input is connected.</p>

      <article id="demultiplexer-functioning">
        <h3>2. Understanding the Functioning of a Demultiplexer</h3>
        <p>Let's delve a bit deeper into the function of a demultiplexer. Demultiplexers are essentially inverse multiplexers. They perform the reverse operation of a multiplexer - a device that combines multiple input signals into one output signal. A demultiplexer takes a single input signal and routes it to one of many output signals.</p>
        <p>The selection of the specific output line is controlled by a set of selection lines, also called control inputs. The number of these selection inputs determines the number of possible output lines. For instance, if we have a 2-to-4 demultiplexer, we have two selection inputs and four possible output lines. In this case, the demultiplexer is essentially acting as a 2-bit decoder.</p>
        <p>Let's visualize it. Picture a busy post office, where one central office (the demultiplexer) is responsible for routing all incoming mail (input signal) to the appropriate local branch (output line). The specific branch each parcel is sent to depends on the postal code (selection input). That's the basic principle of a demultiplexer's operation.</p>

      <article id="demultiplexer-types">
        <h3>3. Types of Demultiplexers</h3>
        <p>Demultiplexers can be classified based on the number of input lines and output lines. The basic types include the 1-to-2, 1-to-4, 1-to-8, 1-to-16 demultiplexer, and so forth. The designation "1-to-n" represents one input and 'n' outputs.</p>
        <h4>3.1 1-to-2 Demultiplexer</h4>
        <p>A 1-to-2 demultiplexer has one input line, two output lines, and one selection line. Depending on the binary value of the selection line, the input is routed to one of the two output lines. This can be represented mathematically as:</p>
        <p>$O_0 = S'\cdot I$</p>
        <p>$O_1 = S\cdot I$</p>
        <p>where $O_0$ and $O_1$ represent the output lines, $S$ represents the selection line, and $I$ is the input line.</p>
        <h4>3.2 1-to-4 Demultiplexer</h4>
        <p>A 1-to-4 demultiplexer has one input line, four output lines, and two selection lines. The selection lines choose one of the four outputs for the input to be routed to. The logic equations representing a 1-to-4 demultiplexer are as follows:</p>
        <p>$O_0 = S_1'\cdot S_0'\cdot I$</p>
        <p>$O_1 = S_1'\cdot S_0\cdot I$</p>
        <p>$O_2 = S_1\cdot S_0'\cdot I$</p>
        <p>$O_3 = S_1\cdot S_0\cdot I$</p>
        <p>where $O_i$ (i ranges from 0 to 3) represent the output lines, $S_1$ and $S_0$ are the selection lines, and $I$ is the input line.</p>

        <h3>4. Implementing a Demultiplexer in C++</h3>
        <p>Now that we have a solid understanding of demultiplexers, let's implement a simple 1-to-2 demultiplexer using C++.</p>
        <pre><code class="language-cpp">
#include &lt;iostream>
using namespace std;
class Demux{
public:
    int input, select;
    int output[2];
    void routing(){
    output[select] = input;
    output[1-select] = 0;
    }
    
    void display(){
    cout << "Output 0: " << output[0] << endl; cout << "Output 1: " << output[1] << endl; }
};

int main(){
  Demux d;
  d.input = 1;
  d.select = 0;
  d.routing();
  d.display();
  return 0;
}</code></pre>

        <p>This code models a simple 1-to-2 demultiplexer. The <code>routing()</code> function routes the input to the appropriate output line based on the selection line, and the <code>display()</code> function shows the state of the output lines.</p>

        <h3>5. Applications of Demultiplexers</h3>
        <p>Demultiplexers find wide-ranging applications in digital electronics and communication systems. Some applications include:</p>
        <h4>5.1 Data Routing</h4>
        <p>In communication systems, demultiplexers are used to route data from one line to multiple lines. They can transmit a large amount of data over a single line, which can then be separated and sent to different parts of the receiving system.</p>
        <h4>5.2 Memory Address Decoding</h4>
        <p>In computer memory systems, demultiplexers are used for address decoding. They can decode the address of the memory location to be accessed from the binary data received, directing the data to the correct memory location.</p>
        <h4>5.3 Control Sequencing</h4>
        <p>Demultiplexers are also used in control sequencing applications where they provide different sequences of pulses to various parts of a digital system to control the operation of that system.</p>

      <article id="demultiplexer-advanced-concepts">
        <h3>6. More Concepts and Design</h3>
        <p>As we delve into the intricate details of demultiplexers, we come across cascading of demultiplexers and the concept of larger demultiplexers like the 1-to-16 demultiplexer.</p>
        <h4>6.1 Cascading of Demultiplexers</h4>
        <p>Cascading is the process of combining two or more demultiplexers to form a larger demultiplexer. For example, we can cascade two 1-to-4 demultiplexers to form a 1-to-8 demultiplexer. The cascading of demultiplexers is often employed in digital systems to increase the system's complexity and efficiency.</p>
        <h4>6.2 1-to-16 Demultiplexer</h4>
        <p>A 1-to-16 demultiplexer, as the name suggests, has one input, sixteen output lines, and four select lines. The select lines determine which of the sixteen output lines the input is routed to. Designing a 1-to-16 demultiplexer involves a complex combination of logic gates and may often involve cascading smaller demultiplexers.</p>
