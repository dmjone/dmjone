        <h3>1. Unveiling the Problem</h3>
        <p>Imagine yourself in the heart of a digital system, where we're immersed in the language of 0s and 1s. It's all around us - every piece of data, every decision made, everything boils down to this simple language. But how do we make sense of this digital soup? How can we perform operations like addition, subtraction or multiplication with just two numbers? The key to unlock these mysteries is Binary Arithmetic. Let's dive in!</p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h3>2. Introduction to Binary Arithmetic</h3>
        <p>In the simplest terms, binary arithmetic is a system of counting using only two digits: 0 and 1. This system lies at the heart of digital electronics, driving everything from your digital watch to the supercomputer at your local university.</p>
        <p>Binary numbers are similar to the decimal numbers we use in everyday life, except that instead of using ten digits (0-9), binary numbers only use two (0 and 1). This might seem limiting, but in the realm of digital electronics, it's incredibly powerful.</p>
        <h4>2.1 Understanding Binary Numbers</h4>
        <p>Imagine a line of light bulbs in front of you, each either on (1) or off (0). This is how binary numbers are represented. Each light bulb is a 'bit', the smallest unit of data in binary, and the line of bulbs is a binary number. The leftmost bit is the most significant, and the rightmost is the least significant. This is much like how, in decimal numbers, the leftmost digit holds the most weight.</p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h3>3. Diving into Binary Arithmetic</h3>
        <p>Now that we've gotten a grasp on what binary numbers are, let's explore how we can perform arithmetic operations on them. This is the crux of digital electronics, enabling computers to solve complex problems using a language of only 0s and 1s.</p>
        <h4>3.1 Binary Addition</h4>
        <p>Binary addition is the simplest arithmetic operation in binary. It works much like decimal addition, with a twist. Here are the rules:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>0 + 0 = 0</li>
          <li>1 + 0 = 1</li>
          <li>0 + 1 = 1</li>
          <li>1 + 1 = 10 (which is '2' in binary)</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>3.1.1 Implementing Binary Addition in C++</h5>
        <pre><code class="language-cpp">
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;bitset&gt;
int main() {
std::bitset&lt;4> num1("1010"); // binary for '10'
std::bitset&lt;4> num2("0101"); // binary for '5'
std::bitset&lt;4&gt; sum = num1.to_ulong() + num2.to_ulong();

std::cout &lt;&lt; "Sum: " &lt;&lt; sum &lt;&lt; std::endl;
return 0;
}
</code></pre>

        <p>This simple program demonstrates binary addition in C++, showing how two binary numbers can be added together to produce a binary sum.</p>
        <h4>3.2 Binary Subtraction</h4>
        <p>Subtraction in binary follows a similar logic to that of decimal subtraction, but with a twist. Here are the rules:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>1 - 0 = 1</li>
          <li>0 - 0 = 0</li>

          <li>1 - 1 = 0</li>
          <li>0 - 1 = 1 (with a borrow of 1)</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>3.2.1 Implementing Binary Subtraction in C++</h5>
        <pre><code class="language-cpp">
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;bitset&gt;
int main() {
std::bitset&lt;4> num1("1010"); // binary for '10'
std::bitset&lt;4> num2("0101"); // binary for '5'
std::bitset&lt;4&gt; diff = num1.to_ulong() - num2.to_ulong();

std::cout &lt;&lt; "Difference: " &lt;&lt; diff &lt;&lt; std::endl;
return 0;
}
</code></pre>

        <p>This simple program demonstrates binary subtraction in C++, showing how a binary number can be subtracted from another to produce a binary difference.</p>
        <h4>3.3 Binary Multiplication</h4>
        <p>Binary multiplication is very straightforward, almost mirroring its decimal counterpart. Here are the rules:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>0 * 0 = 0</li>
          <li>0 * 1 = 0</li>
          <li>1 * 0 = 0</li>
          <li>1 * 1 = 1</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>3.3.1 Implementing Binary Multiplication in C++</h5>
        <pre><code class="language-cpp">
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;bitset&gt;
int main() {
std::bitset&lt;4> num1("1010"); // binary for '10'
std::bitset&lt;4> num2("0101"); // binary for '5'
std::bitset&lt;4&gt; product = num1.to_ulong() * num2.to_ulong();

std::cout &lt;&lt; "Product: " &lt;&lt; product &lt;&lt; std::endl;
return 0;
}
</code></pre>

        <p>This simple program demonstrates binary multiplication in C++, showing how two binary numbers can be multiplied to produce a binary product.</p>
        <h4>3.4 Binary Division</h4>
        <p>Binary division, like its decimal counterpart, is a bit more complex than the other operations. It involves repeated subtraction and shifting, similar to long division in decimal numbers. We won't delve into the specifics here, but just know that it follows the same basic principles as decimal division.</p>
        <h5>3.4.1 Implementing Binary Division in C++</h5>
        <pre><code class="language-cpp">
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;bitset&gt;
int main() {
std::bitset&lt;4> num1("1010"); // binary for '10'
std::bitset&lt;4> num2("0101"); // binary for '5'
std::bitset&lt;4&gt; quotient = num1.to_ulong() / num2.to_ulong();

std::cout &lt;&lt; "Quotient: " &lt;&lt; quotient &lt;&lt; std::endl;
return 0;
}
</code></pre>

        <p>This simple program demonstrates binary division in C++, showing how a binary number can be divided by another to produce a binary quotient.</p>

        <h3>4. Advanced Concepts in Binary Arithmetic</h3>
        <p>With a firm understanding of the basic operations, we can now delve into more advanced concepts in binary arithmetic. These concepts, such as bitwise operations and two's complement, are essential tools in the realm of digital electronics.</p>

        <h4>4.1 Bitwise Operations</h4>
        <p>Bitwise operations are a class of operations that work on individual bits within binary numbers. They're fundamental to low-level programming and hardware design. The basic bitwise operations include AND, OR, XOR (exclusive OR), and NOT.</p>
        <h5>4.1.1 Bitwise AND</h5>
        <p>The AND operation takes two bits and returns 1 if both bits are 1. Otherwise, it returns 0. This operation is often used to mask bits in a number, i.e., to set specific bits to 0.</p>
        <h5>4.1.2 Bitwise OR</h5>
        <p>The OR operation takes two bits and returns 1 if at least one of the bits is 1. Otherwise, it returns 0. This operation is often used to set specific bits to 1.</p>
        <h5>4.1.3 Bitwise XOR</h5>
        <p>The XOR operation takes two bits and returns 1 if exactly one of the bits is 1. If both bits are the same, it returns 0. This operation is often used to toggle bits in a number.</p>
        <h5>4.1.4 Bitwise NOT</h5>
        <p>The NOT operation takes one bit and flips its value. It's also known as the complement operation.</p>
        <h5>4.1.5 Implementing Bitwise Operations in C++</h5>
        <pre><code class="language-cpp">
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;bitset&gt;
int main() {
std::bitset<4> num1("1010"); // binary for '10'
std::bitset<4> num2("0101"); // binary for '5'
std::bitset&lt;4&gt; and_result = num1 & num2;
std::bitset&lt;4&gt; or_result = num1 | num2;
std::bitset&lt;4&gt; xor_result = num1 ^ num2;
std::bitset&lt;4&gt; not_result = ~num1;

std::cout &lt;&lt; "AND result: " &lt;&lt; and_result &lt;&lt; std::endl;
std::cout &lt;&lt; "OR result: " &lt;&lt; or_result &lt;&lt; std::endl;
std::cout &lt;&lt; "XOR result: " &lt;&lt; xor_result &lt;&lt; std::endl;
std::cout &lt;&lt; "NOT result: " &lt;&lt; not_result &lt;&lt; std::endl;
return 0;
}
</code></pre>

        <p>This program demonstrates bitwise operations in C++, showing how two binary numbers can be manipulated at the bit level.</p>
        <h4>4.2 Two's Complement</h4>
        <p>Two's complement is a mathematical operation on binary numbers, and is widely used in digital electronics and computer science. It's a method of representing positive and negative integers in binary format. The beauty of this system is that addition and subtraction are identical operations.</p>
        <p>The two's complement of a binary number is obtained by inverting the bits (changing 1s to 0s and vice versa, also known as one's complement) and then adding 1 to the least significant bit. If the binary number was positive, the two's complement will be negative, and vice versa. This is the standard method computers use to represent negative numbers.</p>

        <h5>4.2.1 Implementing Two's Complement in C++</h5>
        <pre><code class="language-cpp">
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;bitset&gt;
int main() {
std::bitset<4> num("1010"); // binary for '10'
std::bitset&lt;4&gt; complement = ~num;
std::bitset&lt;4&gt; twos_complement = complement.to_ulong() + 1;

std::cout &lt;&lt; "Two's complement: " &lt;&lt; twos_complement &lt;&lt; std::endl;
return 0;
}
</code></pre>

        <p>This program demonstrates the calculation of the two's complement in C++, showing how binary numbers can be negated.</p>
