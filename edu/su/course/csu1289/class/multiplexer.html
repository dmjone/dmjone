        <h3>1. Introduction to Multiplexers</h3>
        <p>Imagine you're trying to send multiple streams of digital data over a single line, such as a telecommunication line, but you're faced with the issue of capacity limitation. How can you possibly overcome this challenge? The solution to this problem lies within a component of digital electronics known as a multiplexer.</p>
        <p>A multiplexer, or MUX, is a device that takes multiple input signals and forwards the selected input into a single line. Multiplexers are used in numerous electronic devices to efficiently manage and route signals, which in turn saves cost and space in electronic circuitry. Let's delve deeper into the world of multiplexers to gain a better understanding.</p>
      </article>
      <article id="basic-of-multiplexer">
        <h3>2. Basics of Multiplexers</h3>
        <p>Multiplexers work similarly to how a train track switch works. Trains (signals) arrive from multiple tracks (inputs) and only one is selected to proceed to the mainline (output) at a time. In the context of multiplexers, the 'switch' is controlled by select lines, which dictate which input will be forwarded to the output.</p>
        <p>The basic idea of a multiplexer can be understood by visualizing a simple 2:1 multiplexer. This multiplexer has two inputs (A and B), one output (Y), and one select line (S). If the select line is at logic 0, input A will be forwarded to the output. If the select line is at logic 1, input B will be directed to the output.</p>

      <article id="multiplexer-implementation">
        <h3>3. Implementation of Multiplexers</h3>
        <p>Multiplexers can be implemented using various digital elements, such as logic gates (AND, OR, NOT), transmission gates, or even programmable logic devices. For a better understanding, let's discuss the implementation of a 2:1 multiplexer using AND, OR, and NOT gates.</p>
      </article>
      <article id="2-to-1-multiplexer">
        <h4>3.1 Implementation of a 2:1 Multiplexer</h4>
        <p>In a 2:1 multiplexer, we have two inputs (A and B), one select line (S), and one output (Y). Here, the output Y can be given as $Y = A\overline{S} + BS$, where $\overline{S}$ is the complement of the select line.</p>
        <p>We use two AND gates to AND each input with the select line (for B) and the complement of the select line (for A). This way, only the input whose associated select line is high will pass through to the OR gate, which forms the output.</p>
        <pre><code class="language-cpp"> 
      // Implementation of a 2:1 Multiplexer in C++

        <h4>3.2 Implementation of a 4:1 Multiplexer</h4>
        <p>A 4:1 multiplexer has 4 input lines, 2 select lines, and one output line. The select lines decide which input to forward to the output. The boolean equation for this multiplexer is $Y = \overline{S_1}\overline{S_0}A + \overline{S_1}S_0B + S_1\overline{S_0}C + S_1S_0D$.</p>

        <h3>4. Types of Multiplexers</h3>
        <p>There are many types of multiplexers, categorized based on factors such as the number of inputs, output, and select lines. Common types include 2:1, 4:1, 8:1, and 16:1 multiplexers. However, a special type of multiplexer known as a "demultiplexer" deserves our attention due to its unique working principle.</p>
        <article id="demultiplexer">
          <h4>4.1 Demultiplexer</h4>
          <p>Contrary to a multiplexer which routes multiple inputs to one output, a demultiplexer does the exact opposite—it takes a single input and routes it to one of several outputs. It works like a multiple-way switch, with the selected output line determined by the values of a set of select lines.</p>
          <p>Just like multiplexers, demultiplexers can be implemented using digital logic gates and also have various types such as 1:2, 1:4, 1:8, and so on.</p>

          <p>A fascinating aspect of multiplexers is their ability to implement any binary logic function. This is achieved by setting the select lines as the function's variables and the inputs as the truth table's output. In this way, multiplexers serve as universal logic gates, further emphasizing their importance in digital electronics.</p>
