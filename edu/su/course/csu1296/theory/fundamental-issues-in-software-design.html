                    </ul>
                </article>

                <article>
                    <h4>1.3 Real-World Scenario</h4>
                    <p>Imagine you are designing a healthcare app for doctors to track patient data. If you fail to understand the specific needs of doctors—such as the ability to quickly access patient history or update treatment plans efficiently—the software may be slow, cluttered, or difficult to use.</p>
                    <p><strong>Scenario Breakdown:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Without User Research:</strong> The app includes unnecessary features, complicating navigation.</li>
                        <li><strong>With User Research:</strong> The app has a streamlined interface, allowing doctors to retrieve critical information in seconds.</li>
                        <li><strong>Outcome:</strong> A well-designed app improves patient care, while a poorly designed one frustrates users and is abandoned.</li>
                    </ul>
                </article>

                <article>
