                    <li><strong>User's Experience with Similar Projects:</strong> Previous experience with software development projects can help decide the extent of user involvement and the type of model to use.</li>
                    <li><strong>Level of User Involvement:</strong> Some models require the user to be involved in every phase (e.g., Agile), while others may limit their involvement to specific stages (e.g., Waterfall).</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            
            <article>
                <h4>2.4 Project Type and Associated Risk</h4>
                <p>Understanding the project type and its associated risks helps in selecting an appropriate process model. Consider the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Stability of Funds:</strong> The availability and stability of funding can determine if a project can handle the iterative nature of Agile or needs the predictability of Waterfall.</li>
                    <li><strong>Project Schedule Tightness:</strong> Projects with strict deadlines may benefit from a more structured process model that minimizes uncertainty.</li>
                    <li><strong>Availability of Resources:</strong> The project’s resources (both human and technical) influence the feasibility of different models.</li>
                    <li><strong>Size of the Project:</strong> Larger projects often require more rigorous planning and management, which is characteristic of traditional models like Waterfall.</li>
                    <li><strong>Expected Duration for Completion:</strong> Shorter projects may prefer Agile for its flexibility, while longer projects may require structured milestones and deliverables.</li>
                    <li><strong>Complexity of the Project:</strong> Complex projects often require iterative, feedback-driven models like Agile to handle uncertainty.</li>
                    <li><strong>Risk Level:</strong> Projects with higher risk may require models that allow for regular reviews and course corrections, such as Agile.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3. Requirement Engineering</h3>
                <p>Requirement Engineering is the process of defining, documenting, and maintaining software requirements. It ensures that the software system meets user expectations, adheres to constraints, and remains adaptable. The process involves gathering, analyzing, specifying, validating, and managing requirements.</p>
            </article>
            
            <article>
                <h4>3.1 Requirement Engineering Process</h4>
                <p>The requirement engineering process consists of four critical phases:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Feasibility Study</strong>: Assessing whether the proposed software can be practically built.</li>
                    <li><strong>Requirement Elicitation and Analysis</strong>: Gathering and refining requirements.</li>
                    <li><strong>Software Requirement Specification (SRS)</strong>: Documenting requirements formally.</li>
                    <li><strong>Software Requirement Validation</strong>: Ensuring correctness and feasibility.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            
            <article>
                <h4>3.2 Feasibility Study</h4>                
                <p>The feasibility study determines whether the software is viable and beneficial.</p>
