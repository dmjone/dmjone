                <h3>Software Design Models</h3>
                <p>Software design models are essential frameworks that structure the development process, ensuring efficiency, quality, and alignment with project goals.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h3>Waterfall Model</h3>
                <p>The Waterfall Model is a linear, sequential approach to software development, introduced by Winston W. Royce in 1970. It is characterized by distinct, non-overlapping phases: Requirements, Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment, and Maintenance. Each phase must be completed before the next begins, making it document-driven and emphasizing quality control.</p>
                <h4>Phases and Sub-Phases</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Requirements: Gathering and analysis, documented in a Software Requirements Specification (SRS).</li>
                    <li>Design: Creating a detailed design document.</li>
                    <li>Implementation: Coding and unit testing.</li>
                    <li>Testing: Alpha (by development team), Beta (by friendly customers), Acceptance (by customer).</li>
                    <li>Deployment: Releasing the software.</li>
                    <li>Maintenance: 60% of total effort, including corrective, perfective, and adaptive maintenance.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Advantages</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Easy to understand and manage, with clearly defined stages and milestones.</li>
                    <li>Reinforces good habits like defining requirements before design.</li>
                    <li>Works well for smaller projects with understood requirements.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Disadvantages</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>No feedback path, making changes difficult once a phase is complete.</li>
                    <li>Late defect detection, leading to a lengthy development cycle.</li>
                    <li>Limited flexibility and stakeholder involvement.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>When to Use</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Projects with well-understood, stable requirements.</li>
                    <li>Small to medium-sized projects with low risk of changes.</li>
                    <li>Regulatory compliance critical, such as government projects.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Real-World Scenario</h4>
                <p>Developing an online banking system where requirements are clear, and changes are minimal. For example, analysis involves gathering banking requirements, design creates system architecture, and maintenance includes security updates.</p>
                <h4>Comparison with Agile</h4>
                <p>Waterfall relies on thorough front planning, while Agile is flexible with repeating cycles. Waterfall suits unchanging projects, whereas Agile fits dynamic ones.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h3>Agile Methodologies</h3>
                <p>Agile methodologies emphasize flexibility, collaboration, and iterative development, focusing on customer satisfaction and adaptability. Popular frameworks include Scrum, Kanban, and Extreme Programming (XP), collectively referred to as Agile after the 2001 Agile Manifesto.</p>
                <h4>Key Frameworks</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Scrum: Uses sprints (typically 2-4 weeks) with roles like Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Development Team. Focuses on delivering value incrementally.</li>
                    <li>Kanban: Visualizes work on a Kanban board, limiting work in progress to improve flow. Emphasizes continuous delivery.</li>
                    <li>XP (Extreme Programming): Focuses on technical excellence, pair programming, and frequent releases.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Principles</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.</li>
                    <li>Working software over comprehensive documentation.</li>
                    <li>Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.</li>
                    <li>Responding to change over following a plan.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Advantages</h4>
                <ul>

            </article>
            <article>
                <h3>Spiral Model</h3>
                <p>The Spiral Model, proposed by Barry Boehm in 1986, is a risk-driven approach combining iterative and waterfall elements. It involves multiple cycles (spirals) with phases: Objectives Defined, Risk Analysis, Engineering, and Evaluation, each addressing risks iteratively.</p>
                <h4>Phases</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Objectives Defined: Clarify functional and non-functional requirements.</li>
                    <li>Risk Analysis: Identify and evaluate project risks.</li>
                    <li>Engineering: Develop software based on requirements.</li>
                    <li>Evaluation: Review and plan the next phase based on feedback.</li>

                </ul>
                <h4>Disadvantages</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Complex to manage due to unlimited phases.</li>
                    <li>High dependency on risk analysis, requiring excessive documentation.</li>
                    <li>Difficult to estimate time and define milestones.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>When to Use</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Large, complex projects with high risks, such as aerospace systems.</li>

            <article>
                <h3>Incremental Model</h3>
                <p>The Incremental Model, also known as the Successive Version Model, breaks down software into smaller modules developed and delivered incrementally. Each increment adds new functionality to the previous release.</p>
                <h4>Process</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Requirements are divided into modules, each following SDLC phases (requirements, design, implementation, testing).</li>
                    <li>First, a core product with basic features is delivered, followed by successive versions adding functionality.</li>
                    <li>Each increment is a complete subsystem, tested and integrated.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Advantages</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Early delivery of partial systems, allowing customer feedback.</li>
                    <li>Easier to manage changes as planning is done for each increment.</li>
                    <li>Reduces risk by breaking down large projects into manageable parts.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Disadvantages</h4>
