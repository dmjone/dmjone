                <h3>Differentiate between Cyber Stalking and Cyber Squatting.</h3>
                <p><strong>Cyber Stalking</strong> </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Unauthorized, repeated harassment or monitoring of a person via digital channels (social media, email, messaging). </li>
                    <li>Goal: intimidate, threaten or instill fear. </li>
                    <li>Methods: persistent unwanted messages, fake profiles, tracking online activities. </li>
                    <li>Example: sending hundreds of threatening emails to an ex-partner.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Cyber Squatting</strong> </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Registering, using or selling domain names similar to established brands or personal names without rights. </li>
                    <li>Goal: profit from resale, mislead users or block legitimate use. </li>
                    <li>Methods: buying domains like “amaz0n-sale.com” or “johnsmith.org” to demand payment. </li>

                <h3>Define Computer Forensics and explain its primary objectives.</h3>
                <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Computer forensics is the systematic process of identifying, preserving, extracting, analyzing and presenting digital evidence from computers and related devices to support legal or investigative actions.</p>
                <p><strong>Primary Objectives:</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Identification:</strong> Locate and recognize all potential evidence on hard disks, mobile devices, cloud storage or network logs. </li>
                    <li><strong>Preservation:</strong> Secure original data by creating exact bit-for-bit copies and maintaining a documented chain of custody to prevent alteration. </li>
                    <li><strong>Analysis:</strong> Examine the preserved copies to recover active, deleted or encrypted files, reconstruct user activities and interpret timestamps. </li>
                    <li><strong>Documentation:</strong> Record every tool, method and finding in detailed, time-stamped logs to ensure transparency and reproducibility. </li>
                    <li><strong>Presentation:</strong> Produce clear, concise reports and expert testimony that explain technical findings in simple terms for judges, juries or corporate decision-makers.</li>

                <h3>What are the key challenges faced in Computer Forensics investigations?</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Data Volume:</strong> Modern drives and cloud accounts hold terabytes of files, emails and logs, making it hard to locate relevant evidence quickly. </li>
                    <li><strong>Encryption &amp; Anti-Forensics:</strong> Suspects use full-disk encryption, secure messaging apps and file-wiping tools to hide or destroy data before it can be recovered. </li>
                    <li><strong>Rapid Technology Evolution:</strong> New operating systems, file formats, mobile apps and IoT devices emerge constantly, requiring investigators to update skills and tools without delay. </li>
                    <li><strong>Chain of Custody &amp; Evidence Integrity:</strong> Every action—from imaging a drive to running analysis—must be logged and defensible in court to prove evidence wasn’t altered. </li>
                    <li><strong>Legal &amp; Jurisdictional Hurdles:</strong> Data often resides in different states or countries, each with its own privacy laws and legal processes, complicating timely access and cooperation. </li>
                    <li><strong>Privacy &amp; Ethical Constraints:</strong> Investigators must balance thorough evidence collection with respecting personal privacy rights and search warrant limitations. </li>
                    <li><strong>Resource &amp; Tool Limitations:</strong> High-end forensic software, write-blockers and specialized hardware are expensive; skilled analysts are in short supply. </li>
                    <li><strong>Time Sensitivity:</strong> In cases like ransomware or insider data theft, rapid response is critical—investigators have little time for deep analysis before systems are damaged or data destroyed.</li>

                <h3>Explain the importance of Chain of Custody in digital evidence handling.</h3>
                <p><strong>Definition:</strong><br>Chain of custody is the documented, chronological record of everyone who collected, handled, transferred and analyzed digital evidence from the moment of capture until presentation in court.</p>
                <p><strong>Importance:</strong> </p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Maintains Evidence Integrity:</strong> Logs every action (who, when, what), ensuring bits remain unchanged and original data is preserved. </li>
                    <li><strong>Ensures Legal Admissibility:</strong> Courts require proof that evidence wasn’t tampered with; a complete chain of custody meets that standard. </li>
                    <li><strong>Establishes Accountability:</strong> Records each custodian and transfer, preventing unauthorized access or handling. </li>
                    <li><strong>Enables Reproducibility:</strong> Detailed documentation allows independent experts to repeat procedures and verify results. </li>
                    <li><strong>Prevents Contamination:</strong> Use of sealed bags, write-blockers and logged transfers deters accidental or deliberate alteration. </li>
                    <li><strong>Builds Trust:</strong> Clear, unbroken records assure judges, juries and stakeholders that findings are reliable.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>Everyday Analogy:</strong><br>Like tracking a registered parcel with signature logs at each handoff, chain of custody in forensics guarantees the ‘package’ of evidence you present is exactly what was collected. </p>

                <h3>List and briefly describe the five phases of the Computer Forensics process.</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Identification:</strong> Spot devices, files and data sources that may hold evidence—like finding key documents in a messy desk. </li>
                    <li><strong>Preservation:</strong> Secure originals with write-blockers and sealed bags to prevent any change—like placing papers in protective sleeves. </li>
                    <li><strong>Acquisition:</strong> Make exact, bit-for-bit copies of drives, memory or logs to work on backups—like photocopying pages to keep the originals intact. </li>
                    <li><strong>Examination &amp; Analysis:</strong> Search copies for active, deleted or hidden data, logs and metadata to reconstruct events—like reading photocopies, highlighting key facts and piecing together a timeline. </li>
                    <li><strong>Reporting/Presentation:</strong> Summarize methods, findings and timelines in a clear report (and testimony if needed) for legal or managerial use—like handing over a concise, bullet-point summary to a judge or boss.</li>

                <p><strong>Data Acquisition Process:</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Secure the scene, isolate the system and document every step for chain of custody. </li>
                    <li><strong>Duplication:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Create exact, bit-for-bit copies of target media (storage or memory). </li>
                            <li>Use write-blockers for disks or specialized tools for live memory capture.</li>
                        </ul>

### What is the goal of computer Forensics in Investigation?

The goal of computer forensics in an investigation is to collect, preserve, analyze and present digital evidence in a legally admissible manner.

1. Identify potential evidence on computers, mobile devices, servers and cloud storage.
2. Secure original media and create exact bit-for-bit copies, maintaining a clear chain of custody.
3. Analyze those copies to recover active, deleted or encrypted information and reconstruct user actions.
4. Document every tool, method and timestamped step to ensure transparency and repeatability.
5. Produce a clear, concise report (and expert testimony if needed) that supports legal or corporate decision-making.


### Define Transnational Crime.

Transnational crime is any illegal activity whose planning, execution or impact crosses national borders, exploiting differences in laws and enforcement between countries.

**Key Characteristics:**
1. **Cross-Border Reach:** Involves people, money or data moving across two or more nations.  
2. **Organized Networks:** Carried out by structured groups coordinating internationally.  
3. **Technology-Assisted:** Uses digital tools (hacking software, encrypted messaging, darknet markets).  
4. **Profit-Driven:** Aimed at financial gain through fraud, trafficking or data theft.  
5. **Legal Gaps:** Exploits variations in legal systems, creating challenges for investigation and prosecution.  

**Examples:**
- A hacker ring in Country A stealing customer records from banks in Country B.  
- Trafficking stolen credit-card data via darknet markets to buyers worldwide.  

**Relevance to Digital Forensics:**
- Requires coordinated evidence collection from devices in multiple jurisdictions.  
- Demands strict chain-of-custody and collaboration with foreign law-enforcement agencies.  

### What is ‘Identity Fraud’?

Identity fraud is the unauthorized use, theft or manipulation of someone’s personal identifying information to commit financial or other crimes for gain.

**Key Characteristics:**
1. **Personal Data Misuse:** Exploits names, government ID numbers, credit-card details.
2. **False Representation:** Criminals impersonate real or synthetic identities to deceive businesses.
3. **Financial Motive:** Opening accounts, obtaining loans, making purchases in victim’s name.
4. **Hidden Crime:** Often goes unnoticed until unusual transactions appear.
5. **Scalable Tactics:** From single-account takeovers to large-scale synthetic identity networks.

**Common Methods:**
- **Phishing & Social Engineering:** Tricking victims into revealing credentials.
- **Data Breaches & Darknet Purchases:** Acquiring stolen personal data online.
- **Card Skimming & Dumpster Diving:** Capturing payment data or retrieving discarded documents.
- **Synthetic Identity Creation:** Merging real and fake data to build new profiles.

**Examples:**
- Fraudster uses stolen SSN to open multiple credit cards and max them out.
- Criminal files false tax refund using another person’s identity.

**Relevance to Digital Forensics:**
- Involves tracing login histories, transaction logs and device metadata.
- Requires correlating evidence across databases, emails and network records to reconstruct the fraud chain.


### What is meant by Phishing attack?

Phishing attack is a type of social-engineering fraud where an attacker impersonates a trusted entity to trick victims into revealing sensitive data or installing malware.

**Key Features:**
1. **Spoofed Sender:** Email or message appears from banks, online services or colleagues.
2. **Malicious Link/Attachment:** Directs user to a fake login page or drops harmful software.
3. **Emotional Hook:** Uses urgency (“Update now!”) or fear (“Your account is locked!”).
4. **Data Theft Goal:** Aims to harvest credentials, credit-card details or personal information.
5. **Mass Distribution:** Sent to large recipient lists hoping for some to fall victim.

**Common Variants:**
- **Email Phishing:** Generic bulk emails with fake invoices or alerts.
- **Spear Phishing:** Tailored messages targeting specific individuals or roles.
- **Whaling:** High-profile targets like CEOs or executives.
- **Smishing/Vishing:** Phishing via SMS or voice calls.

**Everyday Example:**
You get an “Account Suspended” email from “your bank” asking you to click a link and log in—but the link goes to a cloned website that steals your password.

**Forensic Considerations:**
- **Email Header Analysis:** Trace the true origin of the message.
- **URL and Attachment Examination:** Recover malicious payloads and landing pages.
- **Endpoint Artifacts:** Extract browser history, registry entries and downloaded files.
- **Log Correlation:** Tie victim actions to network logs and server requests.


### Define the term ‘HACKING’.

   - **Social Engineering/Keylogging:** (authorized scenarios) deploy scripts to record keystrokes or trick users into revealing passwords.

9. **Document & Report:**  
   - Record tool names, versions, commands used, start/end times and cracked results.  
   - Securely archive logs and outputs as court-ready evidence.

### Define Computer Forensics and explain its primary objectives.

**Definition:** Computer forensics is the systematic process of identifying, preserving, extracting, analyzing and presenting digital evidence from computers and related devices to support legal or investigative actions.

**Primary Objectives:**
1. **Identification:** Locate and recognize all potential evidence on hard disks, mobile devices, cloud storage or network logs.  
2. **Preservation:** Secure original data by creating exact bit-for-bit copies and maintaining a documented chain of custody to prevent alteration.  
3. **Analysis:** Examine the preserved copies to recover active, deleted or encrypted files, reconstruct user activities and interpret timestamps.  
4. **Documentation:** Record every tool, method and finding in detailed, time-stamped logs to ensure transparency and reproducibility.  
5. **Presentation:** Produce clear, concise reports and expert testimony that explain technical findings in simple terms for judges, juries or corporate decision-makers.  

### What are the key challenges faced in Computer Forensics investigations?

1. **Data Volume:** Modern drives and cloud accounts hold terabytes of files, emails and logs, making it hard to locate relevant evidence quickly.  
2. **Encryption & Anti-Forensics:** Suspects use full-disk encryption, secure messaging apps and file-wiping tools to hide or destroy data before it can be recovered.  
3. **Rapid Technology Evolution:** New operating systems, file formats, mobile apps and IoT devices emerge constantly, requiring investigators to update skills and tools without delay.  
4. **Chain of Custody & Evidence Integrity:** Every action—from imaging a drive to running analysis—must be logged and defensible in court to prove evidence wasn’t altered.  
5. **Legal & Jurisdictional Hurdles:** Data often resides in different states or countries, each with its own privacy laws and legal processes, complicating timely access and cooperation.  
6. **Privacy & Ethical Constraints:** Investigators must balance thorough evidence collection with respecting personal privacy rights and search warrant limitations.  
7. **Resource & Tool Limitations:** High-end forensic software, write-blockers and specialized hardware are expensive; skilled analysts are in short supply.  
8. **Time Sensitivity:** In cases like ransomware or insider data theft, rapid response is critical—investigators have little time for deep analysis before systems are damaged or data destroyed.  

### Explain the importance of Chain of Custody in digital evidence handling.

**Definition:**  
Chain of custody is the documented, chronological record of everyone who collected, handled, transferred and analyzed digital evidence from the moment of capture until presentation in court.

**Importance:**  
1. **Maintains Evidence Integrity:** Logs every action (who, when, what), ensuring bits remain unchanged and original data is preserved.  
2. **Ensures Legal Admissibility:** Courts require proof that evidence wasn’t tampered with; a complete chain of custody meets that standard.  
3. **Establishes Accountability:** Records each custodian and transfer, preventing unauthorized access or handling.  
4. **Enables Reproducibility:** Detailed documentation allows independent experts to repeat procedures and verify results.  
5. **Prevents Contamination:** Use of sealed bags, write-blockers and logged transfers deters accidental or deliberate alteration.  
6. **Builds Trust:** Clear, unbroken records assure judges, juries and stakeholders that findings are reliable.

**Everyday Analogy:**  
Like tracking a registered parcel with signature logs at each handoff, chain of custody in forensics guarantees the ‘package’ of evidence you present is exactly what was collected.  

### List and briefly describe the five phases of the Computer Forensics process.

1. **Identification:** Spot devices, files and data sources that may hold evidence—like finding key documents in a messy desk.  
2. **Preservation:** Secure originals with write-blockers and sealed bags to prevent any change—like placing papers in protective sleeves.  
3. **Acquisition:** Make exact, bit-for-bit copies of drives, memory or logs to work on backups—like photocopying pages to keep the originals intact.  
4. **Examination & Analysis:** Search copies for active, deleted or hidden data, logs and metadata to reconstruct events—like reading photocopies, highlighting key facts and piecing together a timeline.  
5. **Reporting/Presentation:** Summarize methods, findings and timelines in a clear report (and testimony if needed) for legal or managerial use—like handing over a concise, bullet-point summary to a judge or boss.

### How does data acquisition work in Computer Forensics? Compare and contrast live and static acquisition techniques.

**Data Acquisition Process:**
1. **Preparation:** Secure the scene, isolate the system and document every step for chain of custody.  
2. **Duplication:**  
   - Create exact, bit-for-bit copies of target media (storage or memory).  
   - Use write-blockers for disks or specialized tools for live memory capture.  
3. **Verification:** Compute and record hash values (MD5/SHA256) on original and copy to prove integrity.  
4. **Documentation:** Log device details, tool names, commands used and timestamps for legal defensibility.

**Live Acquisition:**  
- **Definition:** Capturing data from a running system without shutting it down.  
- **Data Captured:** RAM contents, active processes, open network connections, decrypted data.  
- **Advantages:**  
  - Retrieves volatile information lost on shutdown (encryption keys, running malware).  
  - Essential when powering off would destroy evidence.  
- **Disadvantages:**  
  - Alters system state (writes to memory and logs).  
  - Harder to prove zero-change, requires meticulous documentation.

**Static Acquisition:**  
- **Definition:** Imaging storage devices after powering the system down.  
- **Data Captured:** Entire file system—including deleted files, slack space and unallocated space.  
- **Advantages:**  
  - No writes to source media when using hardware write-blockers.  
  - Results in a repeatable, court-defensible snapshot.  
- **Disadvantages:**  
  - Cannot capture live data (RAM, active sessions).  
  - Requires safe shutdown, which may trigger anti-forensic wipes.

**Comparison:**

| Aspect               | Live Acquisition                        | Static Acquisition                   |
