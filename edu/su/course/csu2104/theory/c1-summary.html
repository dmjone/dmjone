### What Is Forensic Science?

* **Forensic Science** = using scientific methods to collect and examine facts about past events so they hold up in court.
* “Forensic” means **legal** or **related to law**.
* Examples of forensic disciplines: Pathology (injuries), Biology (blood), Jurisprudence (law theory), and **Computer Forensics**.



### What Is Computer Forensics?

* A branch of forensic science focused on finding and analyzing digital information (files, logs, emails) as evidence in legal or corporate cases.
* Main tasks:

  * Recover hidden or deleted data.
  * Prove who did what, when, and how on a computer or storage device.
  * Produce evidence that can **incriminate** (blame) or **exonerate** (clear) someone.



### Related Fields

* **Network Forensics**

  * Examines network logs to see how and when someone accessed a network, which websites they visited, and what changes they made.
* **Data Recovery**

  * Retrieves lost or accidentally deleted files (e.g., after a crash). You usually know exactly what file you’re looking for.



### The Investigation Triad

Digital security in a company uses three main areas:

1. **Vulnerability Assessment & Risk Management**

   * Test systems for known weaknesses (e.g., unpatched software).
   * People in this team launch controlled attacks to find and fix holes.
2. **Network Intrusion Detection & Incident Response**

   * Monitor for attacks or misuse.
   * When an intrusion happens, block it, track the attacker’s methods, and shut down their access.
3. **Computer Investigations**

   * Handle incidents that already happened.
   * Steps: **Identify** what devices and data are involved → **Analyze** to extract evidence → **Report** findings.



### Challenges in Computer Forensics

* Data may be **encrypted** or **deliberately hidden**.
* Evidence can live on many types of media (hard drives, SSDs, CDs, virtual machines, phones).
* Technology and hiding techniques evolve constantly.



### Key Terminology

* **Litigation**: Legal process of proving someone’s guilt or liability in court.
* **Evidence**: Facts or data showing whether something is true.

  * *Inculpatory* = incriminating.
  * *Exculpatory* = clears the suspect.
* **Affidavit**: A sworn statement of facts submitted to a judge (often to obtain a search warrant).
* **Case Law**: Decisions from earlier court cases used when no specific statute exists.
* **Chain of Custody**: Complete history of who handled a piece of evidence, from seizure to courtroom. If broken, evidence may be thrown out.
* **Integrity**: Assurance that evidence hasn’t been tampered with.
* **Investigation**: Systematic process of gathering facts to prove guilt or innocence.
* **Methodology**: A standard, step-by-step procedure investigators follow so they don’t miss anything or spoil the evidence.



### Common Forensic Methodologies

Several formal models exist, for example:

* **DOJ Model** (U.S. Department of Justice)
* **DFRW** (Digital Forensics Research Workshop)
* **ADFM** (Abstract Digital Forensics Model)
* **IDIP** (Integrated Digital Investigation Process)
* **EDIP** (Enhanced Digital Investigation Process)

All share similar phases: **Preparation → Collection → Examination → Analysis → Reporting**.



### Types of Investigations

* **Public (Legal) Investigations**

  * Run by law-enforcement or government agencies under criminal law.
  * Example: A hacker steals money from a bank.
* **Private (Corporate) Investigations**

  * Run by companies under internal policy, not always involving police.
  * Example: An employee uses company email to harass a colleague.



### Public-Case Workflow

1. **Complaint**: Someone reports an illegal act.
2. **Investigation**: Forensic team gathers and analyzes evidence.
3. **Prosecution**: Findings (with the investigator’s affidavit) are used to build a court case.



### The Forensic Investigator’s Role

* **Level 1 (Police Officer)**: Seizes digital evidence at the scene.
* **Level 2 (Detective)**: Manages the case, interviews suspects.
* **Level 3 (Forensic Expert)**: Has deep technical training to handle, recover, and analyze digital evidence end-to-end.



### Investigator Expertise & Conduct

* Must know multiple platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux, plus older systems and mobile devices).
* Should keep growing their technical skills and network with other experts.
* **Professional conduct** demands:

  * **Objectivity** (no bias)
  * **Integrity** (honesty)
  * **Credibility** (trust)
  * **Confidentiality** (keep case details private)



### Certifications & Laws

* Popular certifications: GCFE/GCFA (SANS), CCE (ISFCE), CHFI (EC-Council), EnCE (EnCase), ACE (AccessData).
* Cyber laws vary by country and evolve rapidly—investigators must stay up to date with local regulations.
