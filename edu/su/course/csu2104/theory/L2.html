                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Goal:</strong> The goal of computer forensics is to do a structured investigation and find out exactly what happened on a digital system, and who was responsible for it.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Computer crime is any criminal offense, activity or issue that involves computers.</p>

                <h3>What is Computer Forensics?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Involves obtaining and analyzing digital information, often as evidence in civil, criminal, or administrative cases.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>It investigates data retrievable from a computer’s hard disk or other storage media.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>It involves recovering data that users have hidden or deleted and using it as evidence.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Evidence can be inculpatory (“incriminating”) or exculpatory.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Examples include recovering thousands of deleted emails, conducting investigations after employment termination, post-hard-drive formatting recovery, or investigations after multiple users have accessed the system.</p>

                        <p><strong>Data Recovery:</strong> Involves recovering information deleted by mistake or lost during power surges or server crashes, typically when you know what you’re looking for.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Disaster Recovery:</strong> Uses computer forensics techniques to retrieve lost information, often involving teamwork to secure computers and networks.</p>
                    </li>

                <h3>Digital Evidence</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Locard’s principle:</strong> “Every contact leaves a trace.”</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Any information stored or transmitted in digital form that can be used as evidence in a trial.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>For admissibility, digital evidence must meet criteria such as Admissibility, Authenticity, and a valid Reason for its collection.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Non-Business Environment:</strong> Evidence collected by Federal, State, and local authorities for crimes like theft of trade secrets, intellectual property breaches, fraud, unauthorized use of personal information, extortion, forgery, industrial espionage, perjury, possession of pornography, spam investigations, virus/Trojan distribution, and homicide investigations.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Business Environment:</strong> Involves cases of theft or destruction of intellectual property, unauthorized activity, tracking internet browsing habits, reconstructing events, inferring intentions, selling company bandwidth, wrongful dismissal claims, sexual harassment, and software piracy.</p>

                <h3>Case Study</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>American Express (Amex) claimed that Mr. Vinhnee had failed to pay his credit card debts and took legal action to recover the money. However, the trial judge determined that Amex failed to authenticate its electronic records, disallowing its own business records as evidence.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Issues identified included inadequate details about computer policy &amp; system control procedures, access controls to databases &amp; programs, methods of recording or logging data changes, backup practices, and assurance of record integrity.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>The judge emphasized that the focus is on the preservation circumstances of the record, ensuring that the proffered document is the same as the originally created one.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Lesson:</strong> Document access control, backup procedures and policies; routinely record and log changes; protect electronic records from tampering with modern data integrity and trusted time stamping technologies; and document audit procedures to assure continuing authenticity.</p>
                    </li>
