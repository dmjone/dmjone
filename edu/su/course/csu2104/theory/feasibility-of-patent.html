                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>The user’s proposed <strong>blockchain-based e-voting system</strong> combines several advanced cryptographic techniques – <strong>homomorphic encryption (via TenSEAL)</strong> for end-to-end encrypted tallying, <strong>post-quantum (quantum-safe) encryption</strong>, <strong>zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs)</strong> for privacy and verifiability, a <strong>sharded ledger architecture</strong> for scalability, and <strong>threshold key management</strong> to ensure only authorized trustees can decrypt final results. This analysis examines existing patents (especially in India) related to blockchain e-voting and homomorphic/zero-knowledge voting, evaluates overlap with the proposed system, and assesses whether the design would be <strong>novel and inventive under Indian patent law</strong>. We also recommend <strong>technical refinements</strong> to strengthen patentability and discuss <strong>practical feasibility on commodity hardware</strong>.</p>

                    <p><strong>Other Related Patents:</strong> Many large tech companies and startups have filed patents on <strong>tamper-resistant voting ledgers</strong> and <strong>end-to-end verifiable voting</strong>. For example, IBM and others have patent filings for giving voters a receipt tied to a blockchain entry (to verify inclusion without revealing the vote) (<a href="https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=There%20are%20also%20patents%20focusing,but%20with%20proprietary%20twists">Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one</a>). The <strong>U.S. Postal Service</strong> in 2020 filed a patent for a hybrid mail-in and blockchain voting system (using mailed credentials and a blockchain to record votes) – focusing on combining physical identity verification with a blockchain record (not homomorphic encryption). <strong>Voatz</strong>, <strong>Scytl</strong>, and other e-voting companies have proprietary methods (some possibly patented) using mobile app encryption and permissioned blockchains, though typically with conventional cryptography (AES/ECC) rather than FHE or ZKP. Overall, existing patents tend to cover pieces of the puzzle – <strong>secure vote storage on blockchain, homomorphic tally methods, anonymization techniques, or multi-party key sharing</strong> – but <strong>no single known patent in India or abroad covers the exact combination</strong> of <strong>blockchain + homomorphic FHE tally + post-quantum security + zero-knowledge proofs + sharding for scale</strong> that the user’s system proposes. </p>

                    <h2>Overlap Analysis with Proposed System</h2>
                    <p>The user’s system <strong>integrates numerous state-of-the-art techniques</strong> in one platform. Many of these features individually appear in prior art, but <strong>the specific combination is unprecedented</strong>. Key points of overlap and distinction:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Blockchain Immutability:</strong> Virtually all blockchain voting solutions leverage the append-only ledger to prevent tampering (<a href="https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=,For">Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one</a>). This is a <em>baseline feature</em> – <strong>immutability via blockchain is not novel on its own (<a href="https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=only%20ledger%20of%20votes,For">Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one</a>)</strong>. The proposed system shares this foundation with existing work (e.g. every patent/system listed uses a blockchain or distributed ledger for integrity).</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Homomorphic Encryption for Tally:</strong> Using encryption that allows direct tallying of votes without decryption (e.g. additively homomorphic Paillier or ElGamal) is well-established in e-voting research and patents (<a href="https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=,novelty%20will%20lie%20in%20performance">Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one</a>). For instance, Helios and Agora (research systems) and the Oracle patent above all perform encrypted vote aggregation. <strong>Novelty is not in the concept of homomorphic tally per se</strong>, but in the <strong>specific use of lattice-based FHE (BFV via TenSEAL) and achieving it at national scale</strong>. Most prior implementations used classical schemes (Paillier, ElGamal) which are <strong>not quantum-safe and struggle with large electorates</strong> (<a href="https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=example%2C%20Follow%20My%20Vote%E2%80%99s%20design,novelty%20will%20lie%20in%20performance">Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one</a>). The user’s use of TenSEAL (BFV, a lattice scheme) means <strong>post-quantum security</strong> and potential performance gains via vectorization (<a href="https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=example%2C%20Follow%20My%20Vote%E2%80%99s%20design,using%20CKKS%2FBFV%20for">Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one</a>). This <strong>post-quantum homomorphic approach</strong> is cutting-edge – few if any deployed systems or patents have this yet (<a href="https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=%2A%20Quantum,the%20entire%20system">Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one</a>).</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Post-Quantum (Quantum-Safe) Cryptography:</strong> This is a <strong>differentiator</strong>. Most existing e-voting patents/systems use RSA or ECC for encryption/signatures (vulnerable to quantum attacks) (<a href="https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=%2A%20Quantum,the%20entire%20system">Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one</a>). Only a handful of experimental proposals (e.g. Gao et al.’s code-based scheme) even mention quantum-resistant algorithms (<a href="https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=%2A%20Quantum,the%20entire%20system">Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one</a>). The inclusion of lattice encryption (for votes) and potentially post-quantum digital signatures (like Dilithium for signing voter tokens) in the user’s design is <strong>novel in the context of e-voting</strong> – <strong>a forward-looking feature not present in mainstream solutions (<a href="https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=%2A%20Quantum,the%20entire%20system">Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one</a>)</strong>.</p>

                            <p><strong>Zero-Knowledge Proofs &amp; Anonymity:</strong> Prior art <strong>recognizes the need for voter anonymity</strong> and has used techniques like mix-nets, blind signatures, or ring signatures to decouple voter identity from votes (<a href="https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=%2A%20Mix,immutable%20log%20of%20signed%20ballots">Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one</a>) (<a href="https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=voting%20schemes,Implementing%20homomorphic%20tallying%20actually">Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one</a>). The Oracle patent (US10,504,314) introduced dummy votes with ZK range proofs to hide real choices (<a href="https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=To%20further%20obfuscate%20the%20link,knowledge%20range">Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one</a>). Academic systems like <strong>Open Vote Network</strong> used ZKPs on Ethereum for small groups. However, <strong>integrating one-time voter credentials with ZK-proofs at <strong>national scale</strong> is novel</strong>. The user’s plan for <strong>anonymous one-time voting credentials</strong> (e.g. a blind-signed token per voter) and ZKP-based verification ensures <strong>each vote is valid and unique without revealing voter identity</strong> – an approach not seen in any Indian patent yet. This goes beyond existing Indian filings (which likely rely on simpler authentication or assume a permissioned network). <strong>No Indian patent so far mentions zero-knowledge proofs for e-voting.</strong></p>

                            <p><strong>Threshold Key Management:</strong> Ensuring no single authority can decrypt votes (by splitting the key among multiple trustees) is a known best-practice in voting security and appears in some research (e.g. splitting a Paillier key) (<a href="https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=,schemes%20by%20secret%20sharing%20the">Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one</a>). The concept of <strong>threshold decryption</strong> is not new, but <strong>applying it to a fully homomorphic, lattice-based system is novel</strong> (prior work mostly did this with simpler cryptosystems) (<a href="https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=schemes%2C%20this%20is%20handled%20by,key%20management%20scheme%20where%20no">Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one</a>).

                            <p><strong>Scalability (National Elections):</strong> Perhaps the <strong>largest gap in prior art</strong> is handling a <strong>voter base of 1 billion+ with commodity hardware</strong>.

Most assume either a small electorate or don’t rigorously address scale (<a href="https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=,under%20ideal%20conditions%2C%20but%20an">Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one</a>) (<a href="https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=%2A%20Simple%20and%20Cost,the%20backend%20can%20be%20distributed">Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one</a>). The user’s system is explicitly tackling this with a sharded architecture and other optimizations. This focus on <em>massive scale + commodity hardware</em> is a strong inventive aspect if achieved, since existing solutions struggle here (<a href="https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=,under%20ideal%20conditions%2C%20but%20an">Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one</a>).</p>

                    <p><strong>Summary of Novelty:</strong> The <strong>individual components</strong> (blockchain ledger, homomorphic tally, anonymizing credentials, threshold keys, ZK proofs) each have prior art. <strong>However, no single prior work or patent combines <em>all of these techniques in one end-to-end system</em></strong>. As one analysis puts it, the user’s design “touches on all major components identified in state-of-the-art systems” – meaning it builds on proven concepts – <strong>so baseline overlaps are significant</strong> (<a href="https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=In%20summary%2C%20the%20project%20as,party%20computations%2C%20threshold%20encryption">Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one</a>). <strong>To be patentable and truly novel, the system must go <strong>beyond</strong> those baseline features</strong> (<a href="https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=significant%3A%20immutability%2C%20encrypted%20tallying%2C%20verifiability%2C,which%20we%20discuss%20next">Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one</a>). The combination itself, if implemented with a few unique twists, can be deemed non-obvious. In Indian patent law terms, an inventive step could be argued for the <strong>synergistic integration</strong> of these elements to solve the specific problem of <strong>secure, quantum-resistant, large-scale e-voting</strong>. The presence of similar ideas in pieces means the patent application should emphasize <strong>how these features interact in a unique way or with specific improvements</strong> to overcome the known challenges (scalability, privacy, etc.) that prior systems have not solved.</p>

                    <h2>Novelty &amp; Inventiveness Under Indian Patent Law</h2>
                    <p>Under India’s patent law, <strong>novelty</strong> requires that no single prior publication or patent disclose all aspects of the invention, and <strong>inventive step</strong> means it should not be obvious to a skilled person in light of existing knowledge. Based on the research:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Novelty:</strong> The proposed system appears <strong>novel as a whole</strong>. We did not find any <strong>single Indian patent</strong> that discloses this specific combination of blockchain with homomorphic (FHE) tally, post-quantum security, ZK proofs, sharding, etc. The closest Indian publications (202021030105A, 202341036347A) mention blockchain voting but lack details on homomorphic encryption or ZKP. Internationally, while patents like US10504314B2 cover <strong>homomorphic commitments on blockchain</strong>, and others cover partial aspects, none covers the <strong>exact architecture and methods</strong> the user describes. Thus, the invention is very likely <strong>novel</strong>.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Inventive Step:</strong> Combining known elements can be obvious or inventive depending on whether there’s a motivation or expectation of success in doing so. Here, one could argue it’s non-obvious to <strong>merge FHE (which is computationally heavy) with a blockchain ledger at national scale</strong>, while also incorporating ZK proofs and post-quantum algorithms, <em>and</em> still run on commodity hardware. Each of these addresses a <strong>different challenge (security, privacy, scale, future-proofing)</strong> and balancing them is complex. Patented solutions so far have solved these issues in isolation or smaller combinations. The need to invent new <strong>sharding mechanisms, consensus tweaks, and credential schemes</strong> (as discussed below) to make everything work together suggests an inventive step. Therefore, under Indian criteria, the system likely meets the requirement of a <strong>technical advancement</strong> over existing knowledge and is <strong>non-obvious</strong> to a person skilled in cryptography and blockchain. (It’s not merely an “algorithm or mathematical method” in the abstract; it provides a <strong>technical solution to the problem of secure large-scale e-voting</strong>, which strengthens its patent-eligibility despite involving software).</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Importantly, <strong>Section 3(k)</strong> of the Indian Patents Act excludes “computer programs per se” from patentability. To avoid this objection, the invention should be framed as a <strong>technical system or method</strong> that uses software/crypto to achieve a <strong>tangible result</strong> (a secure voting process) with real-world impact (improved election security). The described system can be claimed as a <strong>“method of conducting an electronic vote”</strong> or a <strong>“secure voting system”</strong> with various technical components, highlighting <strong>technical effects</strong> (like improved security, faster counting, tamper detection). Since the system includes integration with hardware (commodity servers, user devices) and improves efficiency and security beyond a generic algorithm, it should satisfy the requirement of a <strong>computer-related invention with technical effect</strong>, thus clearing the 3(k) hurdle. </p>
                    <p><strong>Conclusion (Novelty/Invention):</strong> The project in its current form would <strong>likely be considered novel and inventive</strong> in India, provided the patent application clearly differentiates it from prior art. It should emphasize the unique combination and how it solves long-standing problems in a new way (for example, “a sharded blockchain voting method enabling fully encrypted tallies with post-quantum security and verifiable anonymity at national scale” – something that hasn’t been done before). The presence of various prior proposals actually helps, because the patent can cite those as <strong>problems or limitations</strong>, then highlight how this invention overcomes <em>each</em> of them in combination. The key is to claim the <strong>specific interplay of features</strong> (e.g. homomorphic cross-shard aggregation, dual-layer encryption with threshold keys, etc.) that is non-obvious. </p>

                    <p>To maximize the chances of patent grant (and strengthen the invention’s uniqueness), consider adding or highlighting the following <strong>technical innovations</strong> in the system design. These refinements not only solve the identified challenges but also make the patent claims more distinct over prior art:</p>

                            <p><strong>🚀 Sharded Blockchain Architecture for Scalability:</strong> Partition the election across multiple parallel blockchains (shards) and <strong>homomorphically aggregate results across shards</strong>. For example, assign voters to regional shards – each shard records votes and maintains an <strong>encrypted partial tally</strong>. After voting, partial tallies (still encrypted) are combined into a global encrypted total using homomorphic addition (<a href="https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=10%2C000%20TPS%29,leveraging%20the%20%E2%80%9Cadditive%E2%80%9D">Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one</a>). <strong>No intermediate decryption</strong> occurs; ciphertexts from shards are added together, preserving end-to-end secrecy (<a href="https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=decrypt,compatible%20with%20commodity%20hardware%20since">Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one</a>). This two-tier architecture (many ledgers feeding into one final tally) allows linear scaling by adding shards, overcoming the single-ledger throughput bottleneck (<a href="https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=nodes,shard%20tallying%E2%80%9D">Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one</a>). This approach is novel compared to known systems, which typically assumed one blockchain handling all votes. It should be claimed as a <strong>“sharded e-voting blockchain with cross-shard homomorphic tallying”</strong> – a clear differentiator for large-scale elections.</p>

                            <p><strong>⚡ Adaptive Consensus &amp; On-the-Fly Vote Compression:</strong> Implement a custom <strong>hybrid consensus protocol</strong> optimized for election day traffic. During peak voting hours, use a fast, centralized or semi-centralized consensus mode (e.g. a rotating leader that quickly batches votes) to achieve high TPS, and later switch to decentralized validation for audit integrity (<a href="https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=consensus%20,a%20block%20into%20a%20single">Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one</a>) (<a href="https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=operate%20in%20a%20high,a%20node%20takes%20all%20votes">Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one</a>). This “dual-phase” consensus (fast mode then secure mode) ensures speed without permanently sacrificing security. Additionally, use <strong>real-time vote aggregation in blocks</strong>: instead of recording every single vote as its own transaction, the node periodically <strong>homomorphically aggregates votes</strong> and writes a combined ciphertext for each candidate at each time interval (<a href="https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=recording%20every%20vote%20as%20a,fly%20aggregation%20in%20a">Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one</a>). Essentially, the blockchain maintains a <em>running encrypted tally</em> that’s updated, rather than a long list of individual ballots (<a href="https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=volume%20,This">Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one</a>). This drastically reduces data volume and improves privacy (no granular timing of individual votes) (<a href="https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=received%20for%2C%20say%2C%20Candidate%20X,approach%20treats%20votes%20more%20like">Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one</a>) (<a href="https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=volume%20,This">Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one</a>). The combination of a mode-switching consensus and in-protocol aggregation is unique – it can be claimed as an <strong>“adaptive consensus and ciphertext compression mechanism for high-speed voting blockchains”</strong>.</p>

Notably, this is <strong>practical on commodity hardware</strong> – the outer encryption/decryption is standard public-key crypto and the inner layer is the existing FHE; it adds security with minimal performance cost (<a href="https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=context%2C%20especially%20using%20post,authorized%20quorum%20can%20unlock%20both">Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one</a>).</p>

For instance, during registration, the voter generates a secret key and gets it <strong>blind-signed</strong> by the authority, or receives a ZKP-based credential attesting their eligibility (<a href="https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=issuance%20of%20a%20voting%20token,time%20use%20is%20to">Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one</a>) (<a href="https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=SNARK%20could%20prove%20%E2%80%9CI%20possess,The">Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one</a>). This credential says “valid voter” but doesn’t reveal who. At voting time, the voter proves they have a valid credential <strong>without revealing it</strong> – e.g. by using a zero-knowledge proof or a linkable ring signature scheme (<a href="https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=proves%20it%20hasn%E2%80%99t%20been%20used,vote">Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one</a>).

Techniques like ZK-SNARKs can prove “I possess a signature on a valid voter token that hasn’t been used” without revealing the token itself (<a href="https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=rejected,in">Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one</a>). This ensures <strong>only legitimate votes are counted once</strong>, yet <strong>no observer can link a vote to a real identity</strong>, even if they collude with the authority (because of the blind signature anonymity). Academically, such approaches exist (in e-cash and some voting proposals), but implementing it at the <strong>scale of a national election with post-quantum considerations</strong> is novel (<a href="https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=and%20can%20be%20rejected,be%20the%20first%20of%20its">Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one</a>). This can be claimed as an <strong>“anonymous one-time voter authentication method using blind signatures and blockchain”</strong>, enhanced by zero-knowledge checks. It complements the homomorphic tally by adding strong privacy. Importantly, it’s feasible: issuing one token per voter and verifying a signature/proof is computationally light (thousands per second on a laptop are possible with modern libraries) (<a href="https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=implemented%20with%20post,it%20remains%20feasible">Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one</a>).</p>

The Oracle patent used range proofs for 0/1 votes (<a href="https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=appears%20to%20cast%20something%20for,system%20can%20homomorphically%20sum%20all">Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one</a>); here we can adapt it to our FHE scheme (e.g. using a simple ZK protocol for binary plaintexts). <strong>(b) Proof of Correct Tally Decryption:</strong> When the final homomorphic sum is decrypted by the Commission, they produce a <strong>zero-knowledge proof that the decryption is correct</strong> and corresponds to the published encrypted total (<a href="https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=critical%20points%20to%20make%20the,or%20simplified%20circuit%20proofs%20since">Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one</a>) (<a href="https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=the%20domain%20is%20small%29,they%20can%20reveal%20a%20random">Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one</a>). For example, in Paillier/ElGamal systems this can be a Chaum-Pedersen proof or revealing a random factor to show no cheating; for lattice-based FHE, perhaps a consistency check by double-encrypting a known value, or a cross-check with an alternate method (like a mix-net result) (<a href="https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=totals,voting">Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one</a>) (<a href="https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=based%20FHE%2C%20verifiable%20decryption%20is,We%20will%20design%20the%20zero">Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one</a>). The idea is any observer can cryptographically verify that the announced winners truly came from the sum of the encrypted votes, <strong>without learning anything about individual votes</strong>. This level of auditability is a hallmark of academic schemes like Helios, but combining it with a blockchain at large scale is novel (<a href="https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=sum%20of%20the%20votes%20on,quantum%20%28since">Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one</a>). Patenting an <strong>“integrated zero-knowledge verification framework for blockchain voting”</strong> would cover this. It’s an extra layer of assurance not seen in current products (e.g., Voatz did external audits, not on-chain proofs). Efficient ZK proof techniques (Bulletproofs, SNARKs) can make these proofs small and batch-verifiable even for millions of votes (<a href="https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=%28Helios%20publishes%20proofs%2C%20etc,these%20can%20run%20on%20normal">Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one</a>). Emphasize that these proofs are designed to be <strong>post-quantum safe</strong> as well (using hash-based commitments or lattice-based ZK, since many SNARKs use pairings that are not PQ-safe).</p>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Each of these enhancements provides <strong>tangible technical benefits</strong> (scalability, security, privacy, verifiability) and would make the patent claims more robust against prior art. They are also <strong>complementary</strong>: for instance, sharding (#1) addresses performance, dual encryption (#3) addresses trust/security, and ZK proofs (#5) address verifiability – together painting a picture of a <strong>complete, innovative voting system</strong>. Including these in the patent (even if some are not fully implemented by next week) is wise, because one can file a patent on the conceived design as long as it’s enabled by the description. The combination of these ideas in one system is very likely unique. As an added benefit, all these proposals <strong>avoid special-purpose hardware</strong> and rely on algorithmic innovation, which aligns with the project’s goal of using commodity machines (<a href="https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=All%20proposals%20deliberately%20avoid%20requiring,found%20in%20earlier%20singular%20systems">Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one</a>).</p>

                    <h2>Practical Feasibility on Commodity Hardware</h2>
                    <p>A critical concern is whether this sophisticated system can run on ordinary hardware (e.g. standard laptops, servers or cloud VMs) given the heavy cryptography. The design decisions seem to intentionally favor practicality:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Homomorphic Encryption (TenSEAL BFV):</strong> BFV is a somewhat homomorphic encryption scheme (lattice-based) supporting addition and limited multiplications. Tallying votes only requires additions of ciphertexts (and perhaps one multiplication by a small plaintext, if encoding choices) – operations BFV handles efficiently. TenSEAL (built on Microsoft SEAL) uses optimized arithmetic (NTL, NTT transforms) and can leverage CPU vector instructions (AVX2) (<a href="https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=operations,If%20it%E2%80%99s%20too%20opaque">Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one</a>). For a national election, one would use powerful servers, but still “commodity” (no need for supercomputers or GPUs strictly, though they could help). The key is parameter selection: using a reasonable polynomial modulus size that balances security and speed. <strong>Batching</strong> many votes into one ciphertext (via BFV’s batching ability) can also speed up processing. Prior systems like Helios (Paillier-based) handled tens of thousands of votes on a single server; lattice FHE is heavier, but improvements in libraries and hardware since then make it plausible. In short, <strong>FHE tallying is feasible on commodity hardware with careful optimization</strong> – especially since we are essentially doing one big addition per vote.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Sharding &amp; Parallelism:</strong> By sharding the blockchain, the workload is spread across many nodes. Each shard (node) only encrypts/validates a fraction of votes, which is well within what a normal server can do. In fact, achieving 10,000 votes/sec could be done by 50 nodes processing 200 tx/sec each (<a href="https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=homomorphically%20combines%20results,tier%20blockchain%20tally%3A%20many%20distributed">Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one</a>), which is realistic for mid-range servers. The final aggregation of partial results is just adding perhaps 50 ciphertexts – negligible overhead. Thus, <strong>scaling out</strong> with more nodes ensures the system can meet throughput demands without any single machine bearing an impossible load. </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Consensus in Fast Mode:</strong> The suggested fast consensus mode (e.g. a leader-based batching) essentially uses a simple coordinator on a normal machine to collect votes quickly – this is similar to how a single database might ingest thousands of writes per second. Modern commodity hardware can easily handle thousands of digital signatures verification and block hashing per second, especially if using efficient algorithms (and since the security model allows a temporary centralization, one can use a beefy server as the coordinator). Post-election, the decentralization (auditors verifying) can happen more slowly without affecting the voting process.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Zero-Knowledge Proofs:</strong> ZKPs can be computationally heavy, but the ones proposed are relatively lightweight: proving a ciphertext is 0 or 1 is a small proof (could use a Schnorr-type protocol or a bulletproof that verifies a value in range [0,1]). Libraries like Libsnark, Bulletproofs, or newer zkSNARK tools can generate and verify such proofs quickly. The analysis suggests modern ZKP libraries “can handle thousands of ops/sec on a laptop” (<a href="https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=implemented%20with%20post,it%20remains%20feasible">Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one</a>) for these kinds of statements. Moreover, these proofs can be generated <strong>offline or in parallel</strong> – e.g., a voter’s device can compute the proof while the vote is being cast, and verification by a node is just a quick check. Batch verification techniques can further reduce overhead if needed (<a href="https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=knowledge%20proofs%20to%20be%20efficient,range%20proofs%20on%20simple%20statements">Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one</a>). So while adding ZK proofs does incur overhead, it’s manageable with today’s CPUs, given that the cryptographic statements are simple (and possibly using elliptic curves or even post-quantum hashes).</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Post-Quantum Signatures:</strong> If the system uses lattice-based signatures for transactions (to be fully quantum-safe), those have larger sizes but are still workable. For example, a Dilithium signature (approx 2-3 KB) is larger than ECDSA (64 bytes), but a block can carry it. Verification of Dilithium is quite fast (milliseconds). Commodity hardware can verify hundreds of such signatures per second per core. Storage might increase (blockchain size), but still feasible with modern disks, especially if votes are aggregated as suggested.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>No Specialized Devices:</strong> The design explicitly avoids things like hardware security modules (HSMs) or trusted enclaves. Everything is done with cryptographic software, meaning one can deploy on standard Linux servers or cloud VMs. This is a conscious choice to ensure ease of deployment (<a href="https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=%2A%20Simple%20and%20Cost,partly%20a%20software%20engineering%20challenge">Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one</a>) (<a href="https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=the%20final%20design%20must%20avoid,like%20BFV%2FCKKS%20require%20large%20polynomial">Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one</a>). As long as the code is efficient (using C++ for crypto heavy-lifting rather than Python in production, for example) (<a href="https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=,lifting%20might%20be">Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one</a>), the system should run on a cluster of regular machines. The biggest resource demand will be <strong>memory and CPU</strong> for FHE operations and <strong>network bandwidth/storage</strong> for the blockchain data. All of these can be handled by commodity hardware at scale by using many machines in parallel.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>In summary, <strong>the technology is feasible on commodity hardware</strong>, especially with the help of the above optimizations. Each vote involves operations like encryption (on voter’s device), adding a ciphertext to a running total (on a node), and at most verifying a proof or signature – all of which are doable on today’s processors. The <strong>heavy-lifting (final decryption, proof generation)</strong> can be distributed among trustees and perhaps done overnight if needed (since immediate results are ideal but even a few hours of computation on standard servers is acceptable for a national election count). The design choices (sharding, batching, avoiding fancy hardware) all point toward a practical implementation. Testing a prototype on modest hardware (e.g. simulating with a few thousand votes) will further validate performance, but from a theoretical standpoint, nothing requires exotic hardware – just <strong>well-optimized software running on enough regular machines</strong> (<a href="https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=context%2C%20especially%20using%20post,authorized%20quorum%20can%20unlock%20both">Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one</a>) (<a href="https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=All%20proposals%20deliberately%20avoid%20requiring,found%20in%20earlier%20singular%20systems">Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one</a>).</p>

                    <h2>Conclusion &amp; Next Steps</h2>
                    <p>Based on current research and patent literature, the proposed e-voting system appears to be <strong>unique and patentable</strong> in India. Similar patents exist in pieces (as shown in the table), but <strong>no single prior work covers the full inventive combination</strong>, especially with a focus on quantum resistance and massive scalability. The <strong>novelty</strong> lies not in using blockchain or encryption alone, but in how the system <strong>combines multiple advanced techniques to achieve a new level of security and scale</strong>. Under Indian patent law, this integration and the technical effect it produces (a secure, scalable national e-voting method) support an inventive step.</p>
                    <p>For a <strong>quick filing (next week)</strong>, consider the following to strengthen the application:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>File a provisional patent</strong> if the full details are still being finalized. A provisional can capture the essence of these innovations (sharding, dual encryption, ZKP, etc.) in broad terms, securing a priority date. You have a working prototype nearly ready – include its key components in the disclosure.</li>
                        <li>Emphasize <strong>real-world impact</strong> and technical problem solution in the draft. E.g., “previous systems could not handle large electorates or were not post-quantum – this invention provides a novel architecture that overcomes these issues.”</li>
                        <li>Use the <strong>refinements above as claim ideas</strong>. Even if not every feature is implemented in the first prototype, including them in the patent ensures you cover future improvements. You might claim, for example, an independent claim on the sharded homomorphic tally process, another on the anonymous credential method, etc., all tied together as dependent claims under a main system claim.</li>
                        <li><strong>Highlight improvements</strong> made in the past weeks: if any one of these novel features (sharding, etc.) has been prototyped or at least designed in detail, focus on that as a centerpiece of the patent. Quick wins could be implementing the blind-signature token issuance (which is relatively straightforward using existing crypto libraries) to demonstrate the anonymity feature.</li>
                        <li>Ensure the patent draft includes <strong>possible alternatives and fallbacks</strong> (e.g., mention both blind signatures <em>and</em> ZK proofs for credentials, various consensus algorithms, both lattice-based and code-based PQ crypto options). This broadens the scope and shows you’ve contemplated multiple embodiments, which patent examiners appreciate.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Finally, before filing, do a <strong>last-minute cross-check</strong> against very recent publications (2024-2025) just to be safe – e-voting is active in research. Given the timeline, it sounds like you’ve done substantial due diligence already. </p>
                    <p>Overall, the invention stands out as a <strong>comprehensive, modern e-voting solution</strong>. By incorporating the suggested refinements and clearly differentiating from existing art, you will make it even stronger. The technology is implementable with today’s hardware and cryptography libraries, which means the patent won’t be merely theoretical – a factor that can positively influence patent examiners. With a well-structured application highlighting novelty in each component, the chances of a grant in India are high. </p>
                    <p><strong>Areas for Quick Improvement:</strong> If time permits before filing, focus on demonstrating <strong>at least one zero-knowledge proof (even in a simple form)</strong> in your prototype and outline the <strong>sharded ledger approach</strong> in your documentation. These will reinforce the “inventive step” arguments. Even a basic test showing two ledger instances whose encrypted counts are added together, or a dummy ZK range proof for a vote, will help concretize the concepts. You can then truthfully claim in the patent that you’ve <strong>tested the key innovative features on commodity hardware</strong>, underlining feasibility.</p>
                    <p>By taking these steps, the project will not only be patentable but also well-positioned as a pioneer in secure, scalable electronic voting – with an Indian patent application capturing that pioneering design. Good luck with your filing! </p>

# Patentability Analysis: Blockchain Homomorphic E-Voting System (India)

## Introduction  
The user’s proposed **blockchain-based e-voting system** combines several advanced cryptographic techniques – **homomorphic encryption (via TenSEAL)** for end-to-end encrypted tallying, **post-quantum (quantum-safe) encryption**, **zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs)** for privacy and verifiability, a **sharded ledger architecture** for scalability, and **threshold key management** to ensure only authorized trustees can decrypt final results. This analysis examines existing patents (especially in India) related to blockchain e-voting and homomorphic/zero-knowledge voting, evaluates overlap with the proposed system, and assesses whether the design would be **novel and inventive under Indian patent law**. We also recommend **technical refinements** to strengthen patentability and discuss **practical feasibility on commodity hardware**.

## Existing Patents in Blockchain E-Voting  
Multiple patents and published applications globally have sought to protect electronic voting mechanisms using blockchain or cryptographic innovations. Key examples include:

| **Patent / Application** | **Jurisdiction** | **Key Features** | **Overlap with Proposed System** |
| ------------------------ | ---------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **US 10,504,314 B2** / **EP 3518187 B1** (2019) – *“Blockchain-Based Anonymized Cryptologic Voting”* | USA / Europe (Oracle Corp.) | Uses **blockchain ledger** with “**cryptologic tokens**” for votes and **homomorphic commitments**. Each voter is issued a private voting token (entitlement) which they split among candidates using homomorphic commitments (e.g. Pedersen commitments). Sum of commitments equals commitment of sum, enabling homomorphic tally ([Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one](https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=representative%20example%20is%20US%2010%2C504%2C314,the%20crucial%20property%20is%20that)). Includes **dummy votes** to every unchosen candidate with **zero-knowledge range proofs** proving each committed vote is 0 or 1 ([Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one](https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=To%20further%20obfuscate%20the%20link,knowledge%20range)). Final tally is decrypted by election trustees. | **Strong overlap in concept**: Blockchain immutability, homomorphic tallying of votes, and ZK proofs for vote values all appear. However, the user’s system uses lattice-based FHE (post-quantum) rather than elliptic curve commitments, and includes additional features like quantum-safe encryption and JWT-secured admin not explicitly covered by this patent. |
| **US 5,495,532** (1996) – *“Secure Electronic Voting Using Partially Compatible Homomorphisms”* | USA (Sako & Kilian) | Early scheme combining different **homomorphic cryptosystems** to validate voters and tally votes without revealing individual votes ([Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one](https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=Another%20example%20is%20US%205%2C495%2C532,another%20for%20signatures%20or%20credentials)). Anticipated use of one homomorphic scheme for eligibility and another for vote tallying, preserving secrecy. | Overlaps in the general idea of **homomorphic vote tallying** and multi-step encryption. The user’s system extends this with blockchain for integrity and modern ZK proofs, plus focuses on post-quantum algorithms. |
| **Indian App. 202021030105A** (Published Aug 2021) – *“An Electronic Voting Device”* (PDPU, Gujarat) | India | **Blockchain-based EVM device** for tamper-proof voting. Emphasizes **quick verification and vote counting**, reduced vulnerability to hacking, and pre/post-tampering security. (Only 2 claims; likely focused on the machine/architecture.) | **Partial overlap**: Uses blockchain for integrity. Unclear if any advanced cryptography (homomorphic or ZKP) is used – not mentioned in abstract. Primarily a device-centric patent to speed up counting, so it likely does **not cover homomorphic encryption or ZK proofs**. |
| **Indian App. 202341036347A** (Published Sep 2023) – *“Autonomous Remote Electronic Voting System (AIREVS) Based on Blockchain”* (RMK Engineering) | India | A **remote e-voting system using blockchain**, presumably enabling voters to cast votes from anywhere with results stored on a distributed ledger. (Details beyond title are scant, but likely uses standard encryption and blockchain records.) | **Partial overlap**: Leverages blockchain for voting. No indication of homomorphic tally or post-quantum crypto; probably a more straightforward implementation. Does not appear to include the **novel cryptographic combinations** of the user’s system. |

**Other Related Patents:** Many large tech companies and startups have filed patents on **tamper-resistant voting ledgers** and **end-to-end verifiable voting**. For example, IBM and others have patent filings for giving voters a receipt tied to a blockchain entry (to verify inclusion without revealing the vote) ([Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one](https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=There%20are%20also%20patents%20focusing,but%20with%20proprietary%20twists)). The **U.S. Postal Service** in 2020 filed a patent for a hybrid mail-in and blockchain voting system (using mailed credentials and a blockchain to record votes) – focusing on combining physical identity verification with a blockchain record (not homomorphic encryption). **Voatz**, **Scytl**, and other e-voting companies have proprietary methods (some possibly patented) using mobile app encryption and permissioned blockchains, though typically with conventional cryptography (AES/ECC) rather than FHE or ZKP. Overall, existing patents tend to cover pieces of the puzzle – **secure vote storage on blockchain, homomorphic tally methods, anonymization techniques, or multi-party key sharing** – but **no single known patent in India or abroad covers the exact combination** of **blockchain + homomorphic FHE tally + post-quantum security + zero-knowledge proofs + sharding for scale** that the user’s system proposes. 

## Overlap Analysis with Proposed System  
The user’s system **integrates numerous state-of-the-art techniques** in one platform. Many of these features individually appear in prior art, but **the specific combination is unprecedented**. Key points of overlap and distinction:

- **Blockchain Immutability:** Virtually all blockchain voting solutions leverage the append-only ledger to prevent tampering ([Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one](https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=,For)). This is a *baseline feature* – **immutability via blockchain is not novel on its own ([Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one](https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=only%20ledger%20of%20votes,For))**. The proposed system shares this foundation with existing work (e.g. every patent/system listed uses a blockchain or distributed ledger for integrity).

- **Homomorphic Encryption for Tally:** Using encryption that allows direct tallying of votes without decryption (e.g. additively homomorphic Paillier or ElGamal) is well-established in e-voting research and patents ([Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one](https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=,novelty%20will%20lie%20in%20performance)). For instance, Helios and Agora (research systems) and the Oracle patent above all perform encrypted vote aggregation. **Novelty is not in the concept of homomorphic tally per se**, but in the **specific use of lattice-based FHE (BFV via TenSEAL) and achieving it at national scale**. Most prior implementations used classical schemes (Paillier, ElGamal) which are **not quantum-safe and struggle with large electorates** ([Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one](https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=example%2C%20Follow%20My%20Vote%E2%80%99s%20design,novelty%20will%20lie%20in%20performance)). The user’s use of TenSEAL (BFV, a lattice scheme) means **post-quantum security** and potential performance gains via vectorization ([Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one](https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=example%2C%20Follow%20My%20Vote%E2%80%99s%20design,using%20CKKS%2FBFV%20for)). This **post-quantum homomorphic approach** is cutting-edge – few if any deployed systems or patents have this yet ([Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one](https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=%2A%20Quantum,the%20entire%20system)).

- **Post-Quantum (Quantum-Safe) Cryptography:** This is a **differentiator**. Most existing e-voting patents/systems use RSA or ECC for encryption/signatures (vulnerable to quantum attacks) ([Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one](https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=%2A%20Quantum,the%20entire%20system)). Only a handful of experimental proposals (e.g. Gao et al.’s code-based scheme) even mention quantum-resistant algorithms ([Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one](https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=%2A%20Quantum,the%20entire%20system)). The inclusion of lattice encryption (for votes) and potentially post-quantum digital signatures (like Dilithium for signing voter tokens) in the user’s design is **novel in the context of e-voting** – **a forward-looking feature not present in mainstream solutions ([Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one](https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=%2A%20Quantum,the%20entire%20system))**.

- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs & Anonymity:** Prior art **recognizes the need for voter anonymity** and has used techniques like mix-nets, blind signatures, or ring signatures to decouple voter identity from votes ([Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one](https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=%2A%20Mix,immutable%20log%20of%20signed%20ballots)) ([Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one](https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=voting%20schemes,Implementing%20homomorphic%20tallying%20actually)). The Oracle patent (US10,504,314) introduced dummy votes with ZK range proofs to hide real choices ([Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one](https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=To%20further%20obfuscate%20the%20link,knowledge%20range)). Academic systems like **Open Vote Network** used ZKPs on Ethereum for small groups. However, **integrating one-time voter credentials with ZK-proofs at **national scale** is novel**. The user’s plan for **anonymous one-time voting credentials** (e.g. a blind-signed token per voter) and ZKP-based verification ensures **each vote is valid and unique without revealing voter identity** – an approach not seen in any Indian patent yet. This goes beyond existing Indian filings (which likely rely on simpler authentication or assume a permissioned network). **No Indian patent so far mentions zero-knowledge proofs for e-voting.**

- **Threshold Key Management:** Ensuring no single authority can decrypt votes (by splitting the key among multiple trustees) is a known best-practice in voting security and appears in some research (e.g. splitting a Paillier key) ([Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one](https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=,schemes%20by%20secret%20sharing%20the)). The concept of **threshold decryption** is not new, but **applying it to a fully homomorphic, lattice-based system is novel** (prior work mostly did this with simpler cryptosystems) ([Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one](https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=schemes%2C%20this%20is%20handled%20by,key%20management%20scheme%20where%20no)). The proposed system’s use of a **distributed key for decryption, requiring a quorum of Election Commission members**, aligns with known ideas but in a new context (FHE). 

- **Scalability (National Elections):** Perhaps the **largest gap in prior art** is handling a **voter base of 1 billion+ with commodity hardware**. No known deployed system or patent has demonstrated **10,000+ votes per second throughput** needed for a national election ([Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one](https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=,a)). Most assume either a small electorate or don’t rigorously address scale ([Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one](https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=,under%20ideal%20conditions%2C%20but%20an)) ([Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one](https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=%2A%20Simple%20and%20Cost,the%20backend%20can%20be%20distributed)). The user’s system is explicitly tackling this with a sharded architecture and other optimizations. This focus on *massive scale + commodity hardware* is a strong inventive aspect if achieved, since existing solutions struggle here ([Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one](https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=,under%20ideal%20conditions%2C%20but%20an)).

**Summary of Novelty:** The **individual components** (blockchain ledger, homomorphic tally, anonymizing credentials, threshold keys, ZK proofs) each have prior art. **However, no single prior work or patent combines *all of these techniques in one end-to-end system***. As one analysis puts it, the user’s design “touches on all major components identified in state-of-the-art systems” – meaning it builds on proven concepts – **so baseline overlaps are significant** ([Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one](https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=In%20summary%2C%20the%20project%20as,party%20computations%2C%20threshold%20encryption)). **To be patentable and truly novel, the system must go **beyond** those baseline features** ([Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one](https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=significant%3A%20immutability%2C%20encrypted%20tallying%2C%20verifiability%2C,which%20we%20discuss%20next)). The combination itself, if implemented with a few unique twists, can be deemed non-obvious. In Indian patent law terms, an inventive step could be argued for the **synergistic integration** of these elements to solve the specific problem of **secure, quantum-resistant, large-scale e-voting**. The presence of similar ideas in pieces means the patent application should emphasize **how these features interact in a unique way or with specific improvements** to overcome the known challenges (scalability, privacy, etc.) that prior systems have not solved.

## Novelty & Inventiveness Under Indian Patent Law  
Under India’s patent law, **novelty** requires that no single prior publication or patent disclose all aspects of the invention, and **inventive step** means it should not be obvious to a skilled person in light of existing knowledge. Based on the research:

- **Novelty:** The proposed system appears **novel as a whole**. We did not find any **single Indian patent** that discloses this specific combination of blockchain with homomorphic (FHE) tally, post-quantum security, ZK proofs, sharding, etc. The closest Indian publications (202021030105A, 202341036347A) mention blockchain voting but lack details on homomorphic encryption or ZKP. Internationally, while patents like US10504314B2 cover **homomorphic commitments on blockchain**, and others cover partial aspects, none covers the **exact architecture and methods** the user describes. Thus, the invention is very likely **novel**.

- **Inventive Step:** Combining known elements can be obvious or inventive depending on whether there’s a motivation or expectation of success in doing so. Here, one could argue it’s non-obvious to **merge FHE (which is computationally heavy) with a blockchain ledger at national scale**, while also incorporating ZK proofs and post-quantum algorithms, *and* still run on commodity hardware. Each of these addresses a **different challenge (security, privacy, scale, future-proofing)** and balancing them is complex. Patented solutions so far have solved these issues in isolation or smaller combinations. The need to invent new **sharding mechanisms, consensus tweaks, and credential schemes** (as discussed below) to make everything work together suggests an inventive step. Therefore, under Indian criteria, the system likely meets the requirement of a **technical advancement** over existing knowledge and is **non-obvious** to a person skilled in cryptography and blockchain. (It’s not merely an “algorithm or mathematical method” in the abstract; it provides a **technical solution to the problem of secure large-scale e-voting**, which strengthens its patent-eligibility despite involving software). 

Importantly, **Section 3(k)** of the Indian Patents Act excludes “computer programs per se” from patentability. To avoid this objection, the invention should be framed as a **technical system or method** that uses software/crypto to achieve a **tangible result** (a secure voting process) with real-world impact (improved election security). The described system can be claimed as a **“method of conducting an electronic vote”** or a **“secure voting system”** with various technical components, highlighting **technical effects** (like improved security, faster counting, tamper detection). Since the system includes integration with hardware (commodity servers, user devices) and improves efficiency and security beyond a generic algorithm, it should satisfy the requirement of a **computer-related invention with technical effect**, thus clearing the 3(k) hurdle. 

**Conclusion (Novelty/Invention):** The project in its current form would **likely be considered novel and inventive** in India, provided the patent application clearly differentiates it from prior art. It should emphasize the unique combination and how it solves long-standing problems in a new way (for example, “a sharded blockchain voting method enabling fully encrypted tallies with post-quantum security and verifiable anonymity at national scale” – something that hasn’t been done before). The presence of various prior proposals actually helps, because the patent can cite those as **problems or limitations**, then highlight how this invention overcomes *each* of them in combination. The key is to claim the **specific interplay of features** (e.g. homomorphic cross-shard aggregation, dual-layer encryption with threshold keys, etc.) that is non-obvious. 

## Recommended Technical Refinements for Patentability  
To maximize the chances of patent grant (and strengthen the invention’s uniqueness), consider adding or highlighting the following **technical innovations** in the system design. These refinements not only solve the identified challenges but also make the patent claims more distinct over prior art:

1. **🚀 Sharded Blockchain Architecture for Scalability:** Partition the election across multiple parallel blockchains (shards) and **homomorphically aggregate results across shards**. For example, assign voters to regional shards – each shard records votes and maintains an **encrypted partial tally**. After voting, partial tallies (still encrypted) are combined into a global encrypted total using homomorphic addition ([Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one](https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=10%2C000%20TPS%29,leveraging%20the%20%E2%80%9Cadditive%E2%80%9D)). **No intermediate decryption** occurs; ciphertexts from shards are added together, preserving end-to-end secrecy ([Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one](https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=decrypt,compatible%20with%20commodity%20hardware%20since)). This two-tier architecture (many ledgers feeding into one final tally) allows linear scaling by adding shards, overcoming the single-ledger throughput bottleneck ([Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one](https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=nodes,shard%20tallying%E2%80%9D)). This approach is novel compared to known systems, which typically assumed one blockchain handling all votes. It should be claimed as a **“sharded e-voting blockchain with cross-shard homomorphic tallying”** – a clear differentiator for large-scale elections.

2. **⚡ Adaptive Consensus & On-the-Fly Vote Compression:** Implement a custom **hybrid consensus protocol** optimized for election day traffic. During peak voting hours, use a fast, centralized or semi-centralized consensus mode (e.g. a rotating leader that quickly batches votes) to achieve high TPS, and later switch to decentralized validation for audit integrity ([Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one](https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=consensus%20,a%20block%20into%20a%20single)) ([Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one](https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=operate%20in%20a%20high,a%20node%20takes%20all%20votes)). This “dual-phase” consensus (fast mode then secure mode) ensures speed without permanently sacrificing security. Additionally, use **real-time vote aggregation in blocks**: instead of recording every single vote as its own transaction, the node periodically **homomorphically aggregates votes** and writes a combined ciphertext for each candidate at each time interval ([Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one](https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=recording%20every%20vote%20as%20a,fly%20aggregation%20in%20a)). Essentially, the blockchain maintains a *running encrypted tally* that’s updated, rather than a long list of individual ballots ([Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one](https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=volume%20,This)). This drastically reduces data volume and improves privacy (no granular timing of individual votes) ([Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one](https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=received%20for%2C%20say%2C%20Candidate%20X,approach%20treats%20votes%20more%20like)) ([Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one](https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=volume%20,This)). The combination of a mode-switching consensus and in-protocol aggregation is unique – it can be claimed as an **“adaptive consensus and ciphertext compression mechanism for high-speed voting blockchains”**.

3. **🔐 Dual-Layer Encryption + Threshold Decryption:** Add a two-layer encryption scheme to enforce strict decryption control. **Each vote is encrypted twice**: first with a lattice-based homomorphic public key (inner layer), then with a second public key (outer layer) held by the Election Commission ([Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one](https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=vote%20is%20encrypted%20twice%20,shares%20in%20a%20distributed%20protocol)) ([Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one](https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=outer%20layer%20is%20an%20efficient,encrypted%20under%20the%20homomorphic%20scheme)). The **inner FHE key**’s secret is **split among N commissioners** (threshold scheme), so no single person can decrypt it ([Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one](https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=but%20we%20add%20a%20unique,shares%20in%20a%20distributed%20protocol)) ([Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one](https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=The%20homomorphic%20addition%20is%20performed,element%20to%20patent%20here%20is)). The **outer layer** can be a faster encryption (even RSA/ECC or a post-quantum KEM) which the Commission collectively controls. During tallying, the Commission uses their shares to **remove the outer layer** (without ever seeing plaintext votes), yielding the inner homomorphic ciphertexts ([Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one](https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=under%20the%20Election%20Commission%E2%80%99s%20collective,encrypted%20under%20the%20homomorphic%20scheme)). Those are then homomorphically added to get totals, and finally the commissioners combine their keys to decrypt the final result ([Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one](https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=3.%20Dual,key%20encryption%20%28%20E_%7B%5Ctext%7Bouter%7D%7D%28%5Ccdot%29)) ([Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one](https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=outer%20layer%20using%20the%20Commission%E2%80%99s,decryption%20of%20the%20homomorphic%20layer)). At no point can any single server or authority decrypt a vote on its own – votes remain *double-encrypted* until the final step ([Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one](https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=is%20%28%20E_,Finally%2C%20to%20get%20results%2C%20the)) ([Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one](https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=Commission%20members%20run%20a%20threshold,It%E2%80%99s%20a%20practical%20improvement)). This **dual-lock approach** ensures even if one layer is compromised, the other layer (which is post-quantum FHE) protects the vote ([Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one](https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=quantum,The%20security%20is%20additive)). It’s an inventive extension of prior homomorphic schemes (which typically use one layer). Claim this as a **“two-layer encrypt-and-tally method with threshold key release”** ([Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one](https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=quantum,The%20security%20is%20additive)) for heightened security. Notably, this is **practical on commodity hardware** – the outer encryption/decryption is standard public-key crypto and the inner layer is the existing FHE; it adds security with minimal performance cost ([Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one](https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=context%2C%20especially%20using%20post,authorized%20quorum%20can%20unlock%20both)).

4. **👤 One-Time Voter Credentials with Zero-Knowledge:** Incorporate an **anonymous credential system** so that each voter gets a one-time use voting token that cannot be linked back to their identity. For instance, during registration, the voter generates a secret key and gets it **blind-signed** by the authority, or receives a ZKP-based credential attesting their eligibility ([Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one](https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=issuance%20of%20a%20voting%20token,time%20use%20is%20to)) ([Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one](https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=SNARK%20could%20prove%20%E2%80%9CI%20possess,The)). This credential says “valid voter” but doesn’t reveal who. At voting time, the voter proves they have a valid credential **without revealing it** – e.g. by using a zero-knowledge proof or a linkable ring signature scheme ([Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one](https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=proves%20it%20hasn%E2%80%99t%20been%20used,vote)). The blockchain or smart contract checks the proof and marks the credential as used (to prevent double voting) ([Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one](https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=When%20it%E2%80%99s%20time%20to%20vote%2C,with%20a%20ring%20signature%20that)) ([Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one](https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=signatures%3A%20the%20voter%20signs%20their,time)). Techniques like ZK-SNARKs can prove “I possess a signature on a valid voter token that hasn’t been used” without revealing the token itself ([Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one](https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=rejected,in)). This ensures **only legitimate votes are counted once**, yet **no observer can link a vote to a real identity**, even if they collude with the authority (because of the blind signature anonymity). Academically, such approaches exist (in e-cash and some voting proposals), but implementing it at the **scale of a national election with post-quantum considerations** is novel ([Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one](https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=and%20can%20be%20rejected,be%20the%20first%20of%20its)). This can be claimed as an **“anonymous one-time voter authentication method using blind signatures and blockchain”**, enhanced by zero-knowledge checks. It complements the homomorphic tally by adding strong privacy. Importantly, it’s feasible: issuing one token per voter and verifying a signature/proof is computationally light (thousands per second on a laptop are possible with modern libraries) ([Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one](https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=implemented%20with%20post,it%20remains%20feasible)).

5. **✅ End-to-End Verifiability with ZK Proofs:** To further enhance trust, integrate **zero-knowledge proofs at critical points of the process**. Two valuable additions: **(a) Proof of Vote Validity:** Each encrypted ballot on the blockchain can carry a ZK proof that “this ciphertext is an encryption of a valid vote (e.g., either 0 or 1 for each candidate)” ([Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one](https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=5.%20Zero,an%20FHE%20ciphertext%20is%20an)). This is akin to a range proof ensuring no one encrypted an invalid value (like 100 votes or a negative vote) ([Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one](https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=5.%20Zero,without%20revealing%20which%20%E2%80%93%20possible)). The Oracle patent used range proofs for 0/1 votes ([Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one](https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=appears%20to%20cast%20something%20for,system%20can%20homomorphically%20sum%20all)); here we can adapt it to our FHE scheme (e.g. using a simple ZK protocol for binary plaintexts). **(b) Proof of Correct Tally Decryption:** When the final homomorphic sum is decrypted by the Commission, they produce a **zero-knowledge proof that the decryption is correct** and corresponds to the published encrypted total ([Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one](https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=critical%20points%20to%20make%20the,or%20simplified%20circuit%20proofs%20since)) ([Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one](https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=the%20domain%20is%20small%29,they%20can%20reveal%20a%20random)). For example, in Paillier/ElGamal systems this can be a Chaum-Pedersen proof or revealing a random factor to show no cheating; for lattice-based FHE, perhaps a consistency check by double-encrypting a known value, or a cross-check with an alternate method (like a mix-net result) ([Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one](https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=totals,voting)) ([Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one](https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=based%20FHE%2C%20verifiable%20decryption%20is,We%20will%20design%20the%20zero)). The idea is any observer can cryptographically verify that the announced winners truly came from the sum of the encrypted votes, **without learning anything about individual votes**. This level of auditability is a hallmark of academic schemes like Helios, but combining it with a blockchain at large scale is novel ([Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one](https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=sum%20of%20the%20votes%20on,quantum%20%28since)). Patenting an **“integrated zero-knowledge verification framework for blockchain voting”** would cover this. It’s an extra layer of assurance not seen in current products (e.g., Voatz did external audits, not on-chain proofs). Efficient ZK proof techniques (Bulletproofs, SNARKs) can make these proofs small and batch-verifiable even for millions of votes ([Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one](https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=%28Helios%20publishes%20proofs%2C%20etc,these%20can%20run%20on%20normal)). Emphasize that these proofs are designed to be **post-quantum safe** as well (using hash-based commitments or lattice-based ZK, since many SNARKs use pairings that are not PQ-safe).

Each of these enhancements provides **tangible technical benefits** (scalability, security, privacy, verifiability) and would make the patent claims more robust against prior art. They are also **complementary**: for instance, sharding (#1) addresses performance, dual encryption (#3) addresses trust/security, and ZK proofs (#5) address verifiability – together painting a picture of a **complete, innovative voting system**. Including these in the patent (even if some are not fully implemented by next week) is wise, because one can file a patent on the conceived design as long as it’s enabled by the description. The combination of these ideas in one system is very likely unique. As an added benefit, all these proposals **avoid special-purpose hardware** and rely on algorithmic innovation, which aligns with the project’s goal of using commodity machines ([Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one](https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=All%20proposals%20deliberately%20avoid%20requiring,found%20in%20earlier%20singular%20systems)).

## Practical Feasibility on Commodity Hardware  
A critical concern is whether this sophisticated system can run on ordinary hardware (e.g. standard laptops, servers or cloud VMs) given the heavy cryptography. The design decisions seem to intentionally favor practicality:

- **Homomorphic Encryption (TenSEAL BFV):** BFV is a somewhat homomorphic encryption scheme (lattice-based) supporting addition and limited multiplications. Tallying votes only requires additions of ciphertexts (and perhaps one multiplication by a small plaintext, if encoding choices) – operations BFV handles efficiently. TenSEAL (built on Microsoft SEAL) uses optimized arithmetic (NTL, NTT transforms) and can leverage CPU vector instructions (AVX2) ([Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one](https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=operations,If%20it%E2%80%99s%20too%20opaque)). For a national election, one would use powerful servers, but still “commodity” (no need for supercomputers or GPUs strictly, though they could help). The key is parameter selection: using a reasonable polynomial modulus size that balances security and speed. **Batching** many votes into one ciphertext (via BFV’s batching ability) can also speed up processing. Prior systems like Helios (Paillier-based) handled tens of thousands of votes on a single server; lattice FHE is heavier, but improvements in libraries and hardware since then make it plausible. In short, **FHE tallying is feasible on commodity hardware with careful optimization** – especially since we are essentially doing one big addition per vote.

- **Sharding & Parallelism:** By sharding the blockchain, the workload is spread across many nodes. Each shard (node) only encrypts/validates a fraction of votes, which is well within what a normal server can do. In fact, achieving 10,000 votes/sec could be done by 50 nodes processing 200 tx/sec each ([Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one](https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=homomorphically%20combines%20results,tier%20blockchain%20tally%3A%20many%20distributed)), which is realistic for mid-range servers. The final aggregation of partial results is just adding perhaps 50 ciphertexts – negligible overhead. Thus, **scaling out** with more nodes ensures the system can meet throughput demands without any single machine bearing an impossible load. 

- **Consensus in Fast Mode:** The suggested fast consensus mode (e.g. a leader-based batching) essentially uses a simple coordinator on a normal machine to collect votes quickly – this is similar to how a single database might ingest thousands of writes per second. Modern commodity hardware can easily handle thousands of digital signatures verification and block hashing per second, especially if using efficient algorithms (and since the security model allows a temporary centralization, one can use a beefy server as the coordinator). Post-election, the decentralization (auditors verifying) can happen more slowly without affecting the voting process.

- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs:** ZKPs can be computationally heavy, but the ones proposed are relatively lightweight: proving a ciphertext is 0 or 1 is a small proof (could use a Schnorr-type protocol or a bulletproof that verifies a value in range [0,1]). Libraries like Libsnark, Bulletproofs, or newer zkSNARK tools can generate and verify such proofs quickly. The analysis suggests modern ZKP libraries “can handle thousands of ops/sec on a laptop” ([Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one](https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=implemented%20with%20post,it%20remains%20feasible)) for these kinds of statements. Moreover, these proofs can be generated **offline or in parallel** – e.g., a voter’s device can compute the proof while the vote is being cast, and verification by a node is just a quick check. Batch verification techniques can further reduce overhead if needed ([Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one](https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=knowledge%20proofs%20to%20be%20efficient,range%20proofs%20on%20simple%20statements)). So while adding ZK proofs does incur overhead, it’s manageable with today’s CPUs, given that the cryptographic statements are simple (and possibly using elliptic curves or even post-quantum hashes).

- **Post-Quantum Signatures:** If the system uses lattice-based signatures for transactions (to be fully quantum-safe), those have larger sizes but are still workable. For example, a Dilithium signature (approx 2-3 KB) is larger than ECDSA (64 bytes), but a block can carry it. Verification of Dilithium is quite fast (milliseconds). Commodity hardware can verify hundreds of such signatures per second per core. Storage might increase (blockchain size), but still feasible with modern disks, especially if votes are aggregated as suggested.

- **No Specialized Devices:** The design explicitly avoids things like hardware security modules (HSMs) or trusted enclaves. Everything is done with cryptographic software, meaning one can deploy on standard Linux servers or cloud VMs. This is a conscious choice to ensure ease of deployment ([Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one](https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=%2A%20Simple%20and%20Cost,partly%20a%20software%20engineering%20challenge)) ([Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one](https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=the%20final%20design%20must%20avoid,like%20BFV%2FCKKS%20require%20large%20polynomial)). As long as the code is efficient (using C++ for crypto heavy-lifting rather than Python in production, for example) ([Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one](https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=,lifting%20might%20be)), the system should run on a cluster of regular machines. The biggest resource demand will be **memory and CPU** for FHE operations and **network bandwidth/storage** for the blockchain data. All of these can be handled by commodity hardware at scale by using many machines in parallel.

In summary, **the technology is feasible on commodity hardware**, especially with the help of the above optimizations. Each vote involves operations like encryption (on voter’s device), adding a ciphertext to a running total (on a node), and at most verifying a proof or signature – all of which are doable on today’s processors. The **heavy-lifting (final decryption, proof generation)** can be distributed among trustees and perhaps done overnight if needed (since immediate results are ideal but even a few hours of computation on standard servers is acceptable for a national election count). The design choices (sharding, batching, avoiding fancy hardware) all point toward a practical implementation. Testing a prototype on modest hardware (e.g. simulating with a few thousand votes) will further validate performance, but from a theoretical standpoint, nothing requires exotic hardware – just **well-optimized software running on enough regular machines** ([Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one](https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=context%2C%20especially%20using%20post,authorized%20quorum%20can%20unlock%20both)) ([Blockchain-Based Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption Voting System - dmj.one](https://dmj.one/edu/su/course/csu2104/theory/analysis-of-blockchain-based-homomorphic-voting-systems#:~:text=All%20proposals%20deliberately%20avoid%20requiring,found%20in%20earlier%20singular%20systems)).

## Conclusion & Next Steps  
Based on current research and patent literature, the proposed e-voting system appears to be **unique and patentable** in India. Similar patents exist in pieces (as shown in the table), but **no single prior work covers the full inventive combination**, especially with a focus on quantum resistance and massive scalability. The **novelty** lies not in using blockchain or encryption alone, but in how the system **combines multiple advanced techniques to achieve a new level of security and scale**. Under Indian patent law, this integration and the technical effect it produces (a secure, scalable national e-voting method) support an inventive step.

For a **quick filing (next week)**, consider the following to strengthen the application:
- **File a provisional patent** if the full details are still being finalized. A provisional can capture the essence of these innovations (sharding, dual encryption, ZKP, etc.) in broad terms, securing a priority date. You have a working prototype nearly ready – include its key components in the disclosure.
- Emphasize **real-world impact** and technical problem solution in the draft. E.g., “previous systems could not handle large electorates or were not post-quantum – this invention provides a novel architecture that overcomes these issues.”
- Use the **refinements above as claim ideas**. Even if not every feature is implemented in the first prototype, including them in the patent ensures you cover future improvements. You might claim, for example, an independent claim on the sharded homomorphic tally process, another on the anonymous credential method, etc., all tied together as dependent claims under a main system claim.
- **Highlight improvements** made in the past weeks: if any one of these novel features (sharding, etc.) has been prototyped or at least designed in detail, focus on that as a centerpiece of the patent. Quick wins could be implementing the blind-signature token issuance (which is relatively straightforward using existing crypto libraries) to demonstrate the anonymity feature.
- Ensure the patent draft includes **possible alternatives and fallbacks** (e.g., mention both blind signatures *and* ZK proofs for credentials, various consensus algorithms, both lattice-based and code-based PQ crypto options). This broadens the scope and shows you’ve contemplated multiple embodiments, which patent examiners appreciate.

Finally, before filing, do a **last-minute cross-check** against very recent publications (2024-2025) just to be safe – e-voting is active in research. Given the timeline, it sounds like you’ve done substantial due diligence already. 

Overall, the invention stands out as a **comprehensive, modern e-voting solution**. By incorporating the suggested refinements and clearly differentiating from existing art, you will make it even stronger. The technology is implementable with today’s hardware and cryptography libraries, which means the patent won’t be merely theoretical – a factor that can positively influence patent examiners. With a well-structured application highlighting novelty in each component, the chances of a grant in India are high. 

**Areas for Quick Improvement:** If time permits before filing, focus on demonstrating **at least one zero-knowledge proof (even in a simple form)** in your prototype and outline the **sharded ledger approach** in your documentation. These will reinforce the “inventive step” arguments. Even a basic test showing two ledger instances whose encrypted counts are added together, or a dummy ZK range proof for a vote, will help concretize the concepts. You can then truthfully claim in the patent that you’ve **tested the key innovative features on commodity hardware**, underlining feasibility.

By taking these steps, the project will not only be patentable but also well-positioned as a pioneer in secure, scalable electronic voting – with an Indian patent application capturing that pioneering design. Good luck with your filing!
