### What is the goal of computer forensics?
Computer forensics aims to collect, preserve, analyze and present digital evidence to reconstruct events and support legal or organizational decisions:
- Spot and secure devices and data without altering originals  
- Create exact bit-for-bit images for safe analysis  
- Recover active, deleted or hidden files and logs  
- Rebuild a timeline of user actions and system events  
- Document methods and findings in clear, time-stamped records  
- Deliver concise reports and expert testimony for courts or management  

### Define traditional crime.
Traditional crime refers to illegal activities that occur in the physical world, often involving direct harm to individuals or property:
- Examples: theft, assault, fraud, vandalism
- Involves physical evidence (fingerprints, DNA, weapons)
- Investigated by law enforcement using established procedures
- May involve digital elements (e.g., surveillance cameras, online transactions)
- Often leads to criminal charges and court proceedings

### What is “identity fraud”?
Identity fraud is the unauthorized use or theft of personal identifying information to impersonate someone for financial or other gain:
- Uses stolen names, SSNs, credit-card numbers or credentials  
- Opens accounts, obtains loans or makes purchases in victim’s name  
- May involve synthetic identities mixing real and fake data  
- Methods: phishing, data breaches, dumpster diving  
- Forensics traces transaction logs, account creation and device metadata  

### What is meant by a “phishing attack”?
A phishing attack is a social-engineering scam where attackers impersonate trusted entities to steal credentials or install malware:
- Sends spoofed emails, messages or websites appearing genuine  
- Uses urgency or fear (“Account locked, verify now”)  
- Directs victims to fake login pages or malicious attachments  
- Variants: spear phishing (targeted), whaling (executive targets), smishing (SMS)  
- Forensics examines email headers, URLs and endpoint artifacts  

### Define the term “hacking.”
Hacking is the unauthorized exploitation of system, network or application flaws to gain access, steal data or disrupt operations:
- Involves exploiting software bugs, misconfigurations or weak passwords  
- Objectives: data theft, service disruption, privilege escalation  
- Categories:  
  - Black Hat: malicious intent  
  - White Hat: authorized security testing  
  - Grey Hat: unauthorized but not purely malicious  
- Techniques: brute-force, SQL injection, malware deployment  

### What is a disk image?
A disk image is an exact bit-for-bit copy of a storage device (HDD, SSD, USB) saved as a single file:
- Includes all files, partitions, slack and unallocated space  
- Preserves metadata and deleted data for analysis  
- Used to work on a copy, keeping the original unaltered  
- Verified by hashing (MD5/SHA256) to ensure integrity  

### What is a bit-stream copy?
A bit-stream copy is a raw, binary-level duplication of storage media, capturing every bit from the first to the last sector:
- Replicates active, slack and unallocated areas  
- Creates a faithful image usable for deleted data recovery  
- Requires write-blockers to prevent any changes to source  

### What is a write-blocker and why is it used?
A write-blocker is a hardware or software tool that prevents any write commands from reaching original media:
- Ensures the source device cannot be altered during imaging  
- Protects the integrity and admissibility of evidence  
- Acts like a one-way valve: allows reads but blocks writes  

### What is live acquisition?
Live acquisition is capturing volatile data from a running system without shutdown:
- Retrieves RAM contents, running processes, network sessions and encryption keys  
- Essential when shutdown would erase critical evidence  
- Risks altering system state; requires detailed logging  

### What is a hash value (e.g., MD5 or SHA-1)?
A hash value is a fixed-length digital fingerprint computed from data; any change to the data alters the hash:
- MD5 produces 128-bit, SHA-1 produces 160-bit output  
- Used to verify integrity of files or disk images  
- Collision risk: two different inputs rarely share the same hash  

### Define Computer Forensics and explain its primary objectives.
Computer forensics is the systematic process of collecting, preserving, analyzing and presenting digital evidence to support investigations:
- Identification: Find potential evidence sources (devices, accounts)  
- Preservation: Secure originals and document chain of custody  
- Analysis: Recover and interpret active, deleted or hidden data  
- Documentation: Record tools, methods and timestamps for repeatability  
- Presentation: Produce clear reports and testimony for legal or corporate use  

### What are the key challenges faced in computer forensic investigations?
- Data volume: Terabytes of files and logs slow analysis  
- Encryption & anti-forensics: Tools hide or destroy evidence  
- Rapid technology changes: New devices, file formats and apps  
- Jurisdictional issues: Cross-border data laws and treaties  
- Chain of custody: Strict logging to prove evidence integrity  
- Privacy laws: Balancing investigation with user rights  
- Resource constraints: Specialized tools and skilled analysts are costly  

### Explain the importance of Chain of Custody in handling digital evidence.
Chain of custody is the detailed record of who collected, handled and transferred evidence:
- Proves evidence integrity by logging every action with timestamps  
- Ensures legal admissibility by documenting secure storage and transfers  
- Establishes accountability and prevents tampering or contamination  
- Enables reproducibility: independent experts can follow the same steps  

### List and briefly describe the five phases of the computer forensics process.
1. **Identification:** Spot devices and data that may hold evidence.  
2. **Preservation:** Secure originals with write-blockers; document custody.  
3. **Acquisition:** Create bit-for-bit images and RAM snapshots.  
4. **Examination & Analysis:** Recover files, parse logs, reconstruct events.  
5. **Reporting/Presentation:** Compile findings into clear, time-stamped reports; testify if needed.  

### Discuss the major legal and ethical issues in a digital investigation.
- **Search Warrants & Privacy:** Must obtain proper legal authority; respect GDPR and local privacy laws.  
- **Chain of Custody:** Strict logging and sealing to prove no tampering.  
- **Evidence Admissibility:** Use accepted methods (ISO 27037, Daubert) to ensure courts accept findings.  
- **Professional Conduct:** Maintain impartiality, confidentiality and avoid conflicts of interest.  

### Describe standard phases of a computer forensic investigation (from acquisition through presentation).
1. **Acquisition:**  
   - **Activities:** Use write-blockers to image drives; capture RAM with tools like DumpIt.  
   - **Challenges:** Locked/encrypted systems; avoiding data alteration.  
   - **Example:** Imaging a suspect’s laptop HDD before analysis.  
2. **Examination:**  
   - **Activities:** Carve deleted files with Autopsy; parse metadata and logs.  
   - **Challenges:** Large data volume; encrypted or proprietary formats.  
   - **Example:** Extracting deleted emails from a disk image.  
3. **Analysis:**  
   - **Activities:** Correlate artifacts to build timelines; identify malicious code with Volatility.  
   - **Challenges:** False positives; complex data relationships.  
   - **Example:** Mapping file timestamps to user login records in a breach.  
4. **Presentation:**  
   - **Activities:** Write concise reports; prepare slides; provide expert testimony.  
   - **Challenges:** Explaining technical details to non-experts.  
   - **Example:** Testifying in court about how stolen data was recovered and traced.  

### What is data carving?
Data carving is recovering files by scanning raw disk images for file signatures (headers/footers) without relying on file system metadata.  
- **Process:** Search for unique file headers, extract contiguous data until footer.  
- **Examples:** Carving JPEG images by scanning for `FFD8…FFD9`; carving PDF by `%PDF…%%EOF`.  
- **Use case:** Retrieve deleted photos when directory entries are removed.  

### What is a journaling file system?
A journaling file system logs metadata changes in a journal before committing them to the main file system to ensure consistency after crashes.  
- **Journal:** Records pending operations (create, delete, modify).  
- **Examples:** NTFS (Windows), ext4 (Linux).  
- **Benefit:** Fast recovery and reduced risk of corruption after unexpected shutdowns.  

### What is the Master File Table (MFT)?
The MFT is NTFS’s central metadata repository where each file and directory has a record with its attributes and data pointers.  
- **Contents:** File name, size, timestamps, security info, data cluster locations.  
- **Role:** Enables fast file lookup and aids recovery of deleted files by accessing orphaned MFT entries.  

### What is keyword searching in forensics?
Keyword searching scans collected data for specific terms or patterns to quickly locate relevant evidence.  
- **Method:** Tools like grep or FTK search text/hex for strings such as “password” or unique identifiers.  
- **Examples:** Searching emails for “confidential”; scanning logs for “Error 0x800”.  

### What is network forensics?
Network forensics captures and analyzes network traffic and logs to investigate intrusions, data exfiltration and malware communication.  
- **Tools:** Wireshark (packet analysis), tcpdump (CLI capture).  
- **Process:** Collect pcap files, filter by IP/port, reconstruct sessions and extract files.  

### What is timeline analysis?
Timeline analysis orders artifacts (logs, file timestamps) chronologically to reconstruct event sequences.  
- **Steps:** Normalize timestamps, merge sources, visualize with tools like Plaso.  
- **Example:** Correlate file creation times with user login events to trace attacker actions.  

### What is metadata?
Metadata is data about data, describing attributes like author, creation/modification timestamps and file size.  
- **Examples:** Document properties (author, creation date); image EXIF data (camera model, GPS).  
- **Value:** Provides attribution and timeline details.  

### What is malware forensics?
Malware forensics analyzes malicious code samples to understand behavior, payloads and command-and-control mechanisms.  
- **Static analysis:** Examine binary code for strings and imports using tools like IDA Pro.  
- **Dynamic analysis:** Run malware in a sandbox (e.g., Cuckoo) to monitor actions and network traffic.  

### What is triage in digital investigations?
Triage prioritizes data sources and devices based on relevance and time constraints to focus analysis efforts effectively.  
- **On-scene triage:** Quick logical acquisition of suspicious files.  
- **Example:** Copy browser history first from multiple devices; defer full disk imaging if time-limited.  

### What is logical acquisition?
Logical acquisition copies selected files and directories via the file system’s API without imaging entire media.  
- **Scope:** Active files, application data.  
- **Limitation:** Does not capture deleted data, slack or unallocated space.  

### List three hashing algorithms commonly used in forensics (e.g., MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256). For each, state one advantage and one limitation.
- **MD5:**  
  - Advantage: Fast computation.  
  - Limitation: High collision risk.  
- **SHA-1:**  
  - Advantage: Better security than MD5.  
  - Limitation: Collision vulnerability proven.  
- **SHA-256:**  
  - Advantage: Strong collision resistance.  
  - Limitation: Slower and larger output size.  

### What is a registry hive? Name two forensic artifacts you can extract from it and their significance.
A registry hive is a Windows database file storing a portion of the system registry.  
- **USBStor entries (SYSTEM hive):** Shows USB device connection history (device IDs, timestamps).  
- **RecentDocs list (NTUSER.DAT):** Records recently opened files for user activity timeline.  

### Explain what slack space is and outline one technique for recovering hidden data from it.
Slack space is unused space in the last cluster of a file that may contain remnants of previous files.  
- **Recovery technique:** Cluster-based carving—read raw clusters and extract hidden data by matching known headers within slack.  

### Define each (volatile vs. non-volatile data), give two examples, and explain why volatile data must be captured first.
- **Volatile data:** Lost on shutdown.  
  - Examples: RAM contents, active network connections.  
- **Non-volatile data:** Retained after power off.  
  - Examples: Hard drive files, system logs.  
- **Reason:** Volatile data contains live system state (encryption keys, running processes) that vanish at shutdown.

- **NTFS:**  
  - Metadata in MFT records (timestamps, attributes, data pointers).  
  - Deleted recovery: MFT record flagged deleted but intact until overwritten; recover via unused MFT entries.  
  - Slack analysis: Read residual data from clusters referenced in MFT.  
- **FAT:**  
  - Metadata in directory entries (file name, size, start cluster) and FAT table (cluster chains).  
  - Deleted recovery: Directory entry marked deleted (first character 0xE5); recover chain via FAT table.  
  - Slack analysis: Extract leftover bytes in the last cluster using raw cluster reads.

An organization’s AWS account shows unauthorized S3 access.
- Describe where and how you’d collect forensic artifacts (e.g., CloudTrail, EBS snapshots, VPC flow logs).
- Detail the process of preserving and analyzing those artifacts.
- Highlight two legal or procedural considerations unique to cloud forensics.

**Answer:**
**Artifact Collection:**  
- **CloudTrail Logs:** Export S3 API call history.  
- **S3 Access Logs:** Enable bucket logging for object-level events.  
- **EBS Snapshots:** Snapshot EC2 volumes for disk analysis.  
- **VPC Flow Logs:** Capture network traffic metadata.

**Preservation & Analysis:**

2. Verify hashes of logs and snapshots.  
3. Parse CloudTrail JSON with `jq` or load into SIEM; correlate user-IDs, IPs, timestamps.  
4. Analyze EBS mounts in a sandbox VM to inspect file changes.

**Legal/Procedural Considerations:**  
- **Jurisdiction:** Data may span regions—ensure compliance with GDPR or local privacy laws.  
- **Provider SLAs:** Request AWS legal hold to prevent log rotation and data deletion.

### Question on mobile forensics.
**Scenario:**
You receive a rooted Android device suspected of containing evidence.
- Outline each step from acquisition to reporting, naming tools you’d use (e.g., ADB, UFED).
- Explain how you’d handle app data, SMS/Call logs, and locked‐screen bypass.
- Discuss one major challenge and how to overcome it.

**Answer:**
1. **Acquisition:**  
   - Document device details (IMEI, OS, root method).  
   - Enable Airplane Mode; disable network to prevent remote wipes.  
   - Use ADB & `dd` to image `/dev/block/mmcblk0`; or UFED for a logical + physical extraction.  

2. **Verification:**  
   - Compute MD5/SHA256 hashes of each partition image and original.  

3. **Analysis:**  
   - Mount images; extract app data from `/data/data/&lt;package>`.  
   - Open SMS/Call logs (`mmssms.db`) with SQLite Browser.  
   - Bypass lock screen by replacing `locksettings.db` via ADB or using `adb shell content` commands.  

4. **Reporting:**  
   - Log tools, commands, timestamps and findings in the chain-of-custody record.  
   - Include screenshots, exported artifacts and hash lists in the final report.

**Major Challenge:**  
- **Full-Disk Encryption:** Blocks access to user data at rest.  
  - *Solution:* Perform live memory capture (RAM dump) to extract decryption keys before powering down.  

### What is an email header? Name two fields you examine and explain what investigative insight each provides.  
An email header is the metadata block at the top of a message that records its path and origin details.  
- **Received:** Shows each mail‐server hop with IP address and timestamp—helps trace the sender’s true network location.  
- **Message-ID:** Unique identifier assigned by the originating mail server—used to confirm authenticity and match related messages.  

### Define steganography, give one way it can hide data in images or audio, and mention one forensic challenge it poses.  
Steganography is the practice of embedding secret data within innocuous files so the hidden content is not apparent.  
- **Example:** Modifying the least-significant bits of pixels in a PNG image to hide a text message without visible changes.  
- **Forensic Challenge:** Detection requires statistical analysis of large datasets and can generate high false-positive rates, making it hard to identify which files actually contain hidden payloads.  

### Explain the purpose of hashing in evidence handling, outline how you generate/verify a hash, and state why it’s critical.  
Hashing produces a fixed-length “fingerprint” of data to prove integrity—and detect any alteration.  
1. **Generate:** Run a tool (e.g., `md5sum` or `sha256sum`) on the original file or disk image to record its hash.  
2. **Verify:** After transfer or imaging, run the same tool on the copy and compare hashes—identical values confirm no changes.  
- **Critical Because:** Courts require proof that evidence wasn’t tampered with; matching hashes form that unbroken chain of trust.  

### Define both terms (swap file and prefetch file), give one example of each, and explain why you’d choose one over the other in practice.  
- **Swap File (pagefile.sys):** Disk‐based extension of RAM where the OS offloads inactive memory pages.  
  - Example: `C:\pagefile.sys` on Windows holds fragments of running programs and decrypted data.  
- **Prefetch File (.pf):** Windows metadata file recording when and how often applications launch to speed startup.  
  - Example: `C:\Windows\Prefetch\CHROME.EXE-ABCDE123.pf` logs Chrome launch times.  
- **When to Choose:**  
  - Use the **swap file** if you need remnants of live memory (e.g., decryption keys after shutdown).  
  - Use **prefetch files** when reconstructing program execution timelines without analyzing full memory dumps.  

### List key browser artifacts (history, cache, cookies). Explain how you’d extract and interpret each artifact in an investigation. Give one real-world example of how browser data solved a case.  
1. **History:** SQLite database of visited URLs.  
   - **Extraction:** Copy the `History` file from the user profile and open with a SQLite viewer.  
   - **Interpretation:** Timeline of sites visited and durations.  
2. **Cache:** Stored page resources (HTML, images, scripts).  
   - **Extraction:** Export cache folder or use tools like ChromeCacheView.  
   - **Interpretation:** Reconstruct viewed pages and download artifacts.  
3. **Cookies:** Key–value pairs storing session tokens and preferences.  
   - **Extraction:** Copy `Cookies` SQLite file and inspect with browser dev tools or scripts.  
   - **Interpretation:** Identify logged-in services, active sessions and session expiry.  
- **Real-World Example:** In a 2016 child-exploitation case, browser cache recovered thumbnail images of illicit material, providing timestamps that matched download logs and led to conviction.

   - **Tool:** John the Ripper  
   - **Drawback:** Exponentially slow as password length increases.  
   - **Preventive Control:** Implement account lockout or rate-limiting after failed attempts.  
3. **Rainbow-Table Attack**  
   - **Process:** Use precomputed tables of hashes to reverse common passwords instantly.  
   - **Tool:** OphCrack  
   - **Drawback:** Large storage requirements; ineffective against salted hashes.  
   - **Preventive Control:** Salt all password hashes (unique per user) before storage.
