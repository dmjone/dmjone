                    <li>Mr. Roy spent rs.44620 on Diwali shopping, rs.32764 on buying a laptop, and the remaining 32% of the total amount he had as cash with him. What is the total amount in all he had with him?<br><br><br>
                        <p>Answer: <strong> 113800 </strong></p>
                        <p>Let's denote the total amount Mr. Roy had as 'T'.</p>
                        <p>According to the problem, Mr. Roy spent Rs.44620 on Diwali shopping, Rs.32764 on buying a laptop, and kept the remaining 32% of 'T' with him.</p>
                        <p>So, the equation would be:</p>
                        <p>T = 44620 + 32764 + 0.32T</p>
                        <p>We can simplify this equation to:</p>
                        <p>0.68T = 44620 + 32764</p>
                        <p>Solving this equation for 'T', we can find the total amount Mr. Roy had with him.</p>
                        <p>T = \(\frac{{44620 + 32764}}{{0.68}}\)</p>
                        <p>= 113800</p>

                        <p>Answer: <strong> 85 marks </strong></p>
                        <p><i>Trick: </i> Digits of 30% + 70% + 15 = 85</p>

                    </li>
                    <li>A silver bracelet is sold for rs.14500 at a loss of 20%. What is the cost price of the bracelet?<br><br><br>
                        <p>Answer: <strong> 18125 </strong></p>
                        <p><i>Trick: </i> Select 4 from 14500 and keep 1 as it is for final number. Select 2 from 20% = 4 x 2 = 8. Therefore 18 and there is 2 so square 5 two times. or 125. Thus, 18125</p>

                    <li>The sum of the number and its reciprocal is 17/4. Find the number?<br><br><br>
                        <p>Answer: <strong> 4 or $\dfrac{1}{4}$ </strong></p>
                        <p><i>Trick: </i> </p>
                        <p>The problem is asking to find a number \(x\) such that the sum of the number (\(x\)) and its reciprocal (\(\frac{1}{x}\)) equals \(\frac{17}{4}\). This can be written as an equation:</p>
                        <p>\(x + \frac{1}{x} = \frac{17}{4}\)</p>
                        <p>To make the problem easier to solve, let's multiply every term by \(4x\) to get rid of the fractions and the denominator:</p>
                        <p>\(4x^2 + 4 = 17x\)</p>
                        <p>Then, rearrange the equation to get a quadratic equation:</p>
                        <p>\(4x^2 - 17x + 4 = 0\)</p>
                        <p>Now, you can solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:</p>
                        <p>\(x = \frac{{17 \pm \sqrt{{(17)^2 - 4 \cdot 4 \cdot 4}}}}{2 \cdot 4}\)</p>
                        <p>\(x = \frac{{17 \pm \sqrt{{289 - 64}}}}{8}\)</p>
                        <p>\(x = \frac{{17 \pm \sqrt{{225}}}}{8}\)</p>
                        <p>\(x = \frac{{17 \pm 15}}{8}\)</p>
                        <p>The solutions are:</p>
                        <p>\(x_1 = \frac{{17 + 15}}{8} = \frac{32}{8} = 4\)</p>
                        <p>\(x_2 = \frac{{17 - 15}}{8} = \frac{2}{8} = 0.25\)</p>
                        <p>So, the number could be either 4 or 0.25.</p>

                    <li>Seven times a two-digit number is equal to 4 times the number obtained by reversing the order of digits, and the sum of the digits of the number is 3. Find the number?<br><br><br>
                        <p>Answer: <strong> 12 </strong></p>
                        <p>Let's denote the tens digit as <em>a</em> and the units digit as <em>b</em>. Hence, the two-digit number is <em>10a + b</em>.</p>
                        <p>According to the problem, we have two conditions:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Seven times the original number is equal to four times the number obtained by reversing the digits. We can express this as <em>7*(10a + b) = 4*(10b + a)</em>.</li>
                            <li>The sum of the digits of the number is 3, which gives us <em>a + b = 3</em>.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>We now have a system of two equations with two variables, which we can solve.</p>
                        <p>From the first equation, we can simplify to <em>70a + 7b = 40b + 4a</em>, which simplifies to <em>66a = 33b</em>. Simplifying this further gives <em>2a = b</em>.</p>
                        <p>Now substitute <em>2a</em> for <em>b</em> in the second equation (<em>a + b = 3</em>) to solve for <em>a</em>:</p>
                        <p><em>a + 2a = 3</em></p>
                        <p><em>3a = 3</em></p>
                        <p><em>a = 1</em></p>
                        <p>Substitute <em>a = 1</em> into the equation <em>2a = b</em> to find <em>b</em>:</p>
                        <p><em>2*1 = b</em></p>
                        <p><em>b = 2</em></p>
                        <p>So, the original two-digit number is 12.</p>
