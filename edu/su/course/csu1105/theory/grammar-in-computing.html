                <h3>1. Grammar in Theory of Computing</h3>
                <p>In the realm of Theory of Computing (ToC), grammar is essential for defining languages, akin to the grammar of natural languages, but focuses on programming and formal languages. It sets the foundation for the structured communication between computational processes and human understanding, highlighting the pivotal role of rules in constructing meaningful and syntactically correct sentences or commands.</p>

            <article>
                <h4>1.1 Types of Grammars</h4>
                <p>The Chomsky Hierarchy categorizes grammars into four distinct types based on their production rules and the complexity of the languages they generate, ranging from Type 0: Unrestricted Grammars, which are the most general, to Type 3: Regular Grammars, which are the most restrictive. This classification facilitates understanding the capabilities and limitations of various grammar types in defining languages.</p>

                <h4>1.2 Context-Free Grammars (CFGs) in Depth</h4>
                <p>Context-Free Grammars (CFGs) hold particular importance in computer science for their efficiency in defining programming languages and designing compilers. Comprising terminal and non-terminal symbols, a start symbol, and production rules, CFGs strike a balance between expressive power and analytical tractability, making them ideal for syntax representation in programming languages.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h4>1.3 Practical Application of CFGs</h4>
                <p>CFGs are pivotal in software development, especially in compiler design for parsing programming languages. They define syntax rules that enable compilers to translate high-level code into machine-executable code, illustrated by the grammar for arithmetic expressions, which underscores the utility of CFGs in making software development feasible and efficient.</p>

            <article>
                <h4>1.4 Real-World Connections</h4>
                <p>The application of grammar in computing extends to understanding natural languages and designing AI, where CFG-like rules enable technologies such as voice recognition and automated translation. This demonstrates the broader impact of computational grammars in bridging human-computer interaction.</p>

                <h3>2. Symbols Used in Grammar</h3>
                <p>In formal grammars within ToC, symbols including terminals, non-terminals, the start symbol, and production rules are crucial for constructing grammars and defining languages, offering a framework for analyzing and generating the strings of a language.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h4>2.1 Terminal Symbols</h4>
                <p>Terminal symbols are the fundamental building blocks of a language, representing the indivisible units in the strings of the language, and play a critical role in defining the language's alphabet, particularly in programming languages where they include literals, identifiers, and operators.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h4>2.2 Non-terminal Symbols</h4>
                <p>Non-terminal symbols function as placeholders within a grammar that can be expanded into sequences of terminals and non-terminals, facilitating the definition of the language's structure and the generation of its strings.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h4>2.3 Start Symbol</h4>
                <p>The start symbol is the inception point for generating strings in a language, emphasizing its significance in the overall structure and definition of the language facilitated by a grammar.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h4>2.4 Production Rules</h4>
                <p>Production rules dictate the transformation of non-terminal symbols into terminals and non-terminals, constituting the core mechanism through which grammars define the syntax and structure of languages.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h4>2.5 Practical Example: Defining a Simple Language</h4>
                <p>Illustrating with a simple language of arithmetic expressions, the cohesive function of terminal symbols, non-terminal symbols, the start symbol, and production rules demonstrates how grammars facilitate the definition and analysis of language syntax, highlighting the practical application of these concepts in computational linguistics and programming.</p>

                <h3>3. Grammars and Languages</h3>
                <p>The relationship between grammars and the languages they define is foundational in ToC, with a formal grammar defined by a tuple \(G = (V, T, P, S)\) that encapsulates its structure and rules, enabling the generation and recognition of strings within a language.</p>
            </article>
