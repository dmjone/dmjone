                <h3>Mealy Machine</h3>
                <p>A Mealy Machine is a fundamental concept within the Theory of Computing, constituting one of the two types of finite state machines, the other being the Moore Machine. A Mealy Machine is defined as a 6-tuple $(Q, \Sigma, \Omega, \delta, \lambda, q_0)$ where:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>$Q$ is a finite set of states,</li>
                    <li>$\Sigma$ is a finite input alphabet,</li>
                    <li>$\Omega$ is a finite output alphabet,</li>
                    <li>$\delta: Q \times \Sigma \rightarrow Q$ is the transition function,</li>
                    <li>$\lambda: Q \times \Sigma \rightarrow \Omega$ is the output function, and</li>
                    <li>$q_0$ is the initial state.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Unlike the Moore Machine, which generates its outputs based solely on its current state, the output of a Mealy Machine is determined by its current state and the current input. This property allows Mealy Machines to potentially have a more immediate response to inputs, as the output can change without the state needing to change.</p>

                <h4>1.1 Characteristics of Mealy Machines</h4>
                <p>Mealy Machines are characterized by their responsive nature to inputs, making them suitable for applications where output needs to rapidly adjust based on incoming data. They are often used in digital circuits, communication protocols, and control systems. One of the key advantages of Mealy Machines is their ability to minimize the number of states needed for certain tasks, as the same state can produce different outputs based on different inputs.</p>

                <h4>1.2 Real-World Applications</h4>
                <p>In practical terms, Mealy Machines can be found in a variety of real-world applications. For instance, in networked systems, a Mealy Machine might be used to manage the state of a connection, with outputs and subsequent states determined by both the current state of the connection and the packets being received. In user interface design, the behavior of graphical elements can be modeled with Mealy Machines, where the elements react immediately to user inputs based on both the type of input and the current state of the UI.</p>

                <h5>1.2.1 Example: Traffic Light Control System</h5>
                <p>Consider a traffic light control system designed as a Mealy Machine. The system's states could represent the current color of the traffic light (Red, Yellow, Green), while the input might be a timer signal or sensors detecting the presence of vehicles. The output function could determine whether to change the light and to which color, based on both the current light and the traffic conditions. This demonstrates how Mealy Machines facilitate immediate responses to changing inputs, making them highly effective for control systems.</p>

                <pre><code class="language-auto">// Pseudo-code for a simple traffic light control Mealy Machine
function trafficLightControl(currentState, input) {
  switch (currentState) {
    case 'Green':
      if (input === 'timerExpired') return { nextState: 'Yellow', output: 'Change to Yellow' };
      break;
    case 'Yellow':
      if (input === 'timerExpired') return { nextState: 'Red', output: 'Change to Red' };
      break;
    case 'Red':
      if (input === 'carWaiting' || input === 'timerExpired') return { nextState: 'Green', output: 'Change to Green' };
      break;
  }
  return { nextState: currentState, output: 'No Change' };
}
</code></pre>
                <p>This example illustrates the flexibility and immediate responsiveness of Mealy Machines to inputs, essential characteristics for systems requiring real-time decision-making.</p>
