                <h3>1. Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA)</h3>
                <p>Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) is a theoretical model of computation that serves as a cornerstone in the field of Theory of Computing. A DFA can be thought of as a simple, abstract machine used to recognize patterns within input strings. It comprises a finite number of states, with one state being designated as the starting state and certain states being recognized as accepting states. The machine reads a string of symbols (input) one symbol at a time. For each symbol, it transitions from one state to another according to a predefined set of rules (transition function). If the machine ends in an accepting state after reading the entire string, the string is considered recognized by the DFA.</p>

                <h4>1.1 Structure of a DFA</h4>
                <p>A DFA is defined by a 5-tuple, \((Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)\), where:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>\(Q\) is a finite set of states,</li>
                    <li>\(\Sigma\) is a finite set of input symbols (alphabet),</li>
                    <li>\(\delta: Q \times \Sigma \rightarrow Q\) is the transition function,</li>
                    <li>\(q_0 \in Q\) is the start state,</li>
                    <li>\(F \subseteq Q\) is the set of accepting states.</li>
                </ul>

            <article id="functioning-of-a-dfa">
                <h4>1.2 Functioning of a DFA</h4>
                <p>A DFA processes a string of symbols from \(\Sigma\) by starting at the state \(q_0\) and reading the string one symbol at a time. At each step, it uses the transition function \(\delta\) to determine the next state based on the current state and the current input symbol. This process continues until the string is completely read. If the state at which the DFA stops is an accepting state (\(F\)), then the string is accepted; otherwise, it is rejected.</p>

                <h4>1.3 Real-world Applications of DFA</h4>
                <p>DFAs have practical applications in various fields, including computer science, linguistics, and engineering. One common application is in the design of lexical analyzers for programming languages, which are tools that categorize program text into meaningful elements like keywords, literals, and identifiers. This process is fundamental for compilers and interpreters to understand and translate programming languages. DFAs are also used in network protocols for parsing messages, in text editors for search functionalities, and in digital circuits for controlling sequences of operations.</p>
                <article>
                    <h5>1.3.1 Text Parsing and Lexical Analysis</h5>
                    <p>In programming language compilers, DFAs are employed to perform lexical analysis. Lexical analysis is the process of converting a sequence of characters into a sequence of tokens. A token is a string with an assigned and thus identified meaning. For instance, identifying keywords, operators, and identifiers in a programming language. This step is crucial for syntactic analysis and the subsequent stages of compilation.</p>

                    <h5>1.3.2 Network Protocol Design</h5>
                    <p>DFAs are used in the design of network protocols to manage the sequence of messages exchanged between systems. In protocols, states can represent the status of a connection (e.g., established, waiting, closed), and transitions can represent the reception or sending of specific messages, ensuring that the systems communicate following the defined protocol rules.</p>

                    <h5>1.3.3 Digital Circuit Design</h5>
                    <p>In digital circuits, DFAs are used to design finite state machines (FSMs) that control the behavior of digital systems. These state machines can manage anything from simple sequence generators to complex system controllers, where the inputs to the FSM cause transitions between states, resulting in outputs that control the operation of the system.</p>

                <h4>1.4 Designing a DFA</h4>
                <p>Designing a DFA involves identifying the set of states, the alphabet, the transition function, the start state, and the accepting states. The process typically begins with defining the problem to be solved or the pattern to be recognized, followed by determining the states and transitions that will allow the DFA to recognize the desired patterns in input strings.</p>

            <article>
                <h4>1.5 Limitations of DFAs</h4>
                <p>While DFAs are powerful tools for pattern recognition and parsing, they have limitations. DFAs cannot recognize certain types of patterns, such as those that require counting or memory beyond a finite state. This limitation is addressed by more powerful computational models like pushdown automata and Turing machines, which can handle a broader class of problems by utilizing additional memory resources.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h4>1.6 DFA (Deterministic Finite Automata) Use Cases</h4>
                <p>DFA is a model of computation that defines how a set of states, an initial state, an input alphabet, and a transition function determine a new state from a current state and input symbol. DFAs are used in scenarios requiring a straightforward, predictable path of execution.</p>
