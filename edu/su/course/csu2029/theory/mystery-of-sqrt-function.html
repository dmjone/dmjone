                <h3>1. Square Root of a Number</h3>
                <p>The square root of a number is a number that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number.</p>
                <p>In other words, the square root of a number $ N $ is a value $ x $ such that $ x^2 = N $.</p>
                <p>It is represented as:</p>
                <p>$$ \sqrt{N} = x $$</p>
                <p>For example, the square root of 25 is 5, because $ 5^2 = 25 $. Every positive real number has two square roots: one positive and one negative. For instance:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The square roots of 25 are $ +5 $ and $ -5 $.</li>
                    <li>The principal square root refers to the positive square root, denoted by $ \sqrt{N} $.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>

                <h4>1.1 Properties of Square Roots</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Non-negative Numbers:</strong> The square root of a non-negative number is always a non-negative number.</li>
                    <li><strong>Perfect Squares:</strong> The square root of a perfect square (e.g., 1, 4, 9, 16) is always an integer.</li>
                    <li><strong>Irrational Square Roots:</strong> The square root of a non-perfect square (e.g., 2, 3, 5) is irrational and cannot be expressed exactly as a fraction.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>1.2 Mathematical Representation</h4>
                <p>The square root function can be expressed using exponent notation:</p>
                <p>$$ \sqrt{N} = N^{1/2} $$</p>
                <p>This representation helps in simplifying and manipulating expressions involving square roots.</p>

                <h3>2. Methods of Finding Square Root of a Number - Using sqrt Functions</h3>
                <p>One of the simplest and most commonly used ways to find the square root of a number is through built-in <code>sqrt</code> functions provided by various programming languages and libraries. These functions are optimized to quickly compute the square root of a given number, typically using highly efficient underlying algorithms.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>2.1 Using sqrt in Python (math.sqrt)</h4>
                <p>In Python, the <code>math</code> module provides the <code>sqrt</code> function, which computes the square root of a number. The result is always a floating-point number.</p>
                <pre><code class="language-python">
import math

# Example: Finding square root of 16
result = math.sqrt(16)
print(result)  # Output: 4.0
</code></pre>
                <p>Here, <code>math.sqrt(16)</code> returns 4.0, which is the square root of 16.</p>
            </article>

                <h4>2.2 Using sqrt in C++ (cmath library)</h4>
                <p>In C++, the <code>cmath</code> library provides the <code>sqrt</code> function, which computes the square root of a number.</p>
                <pre><code class="language-cpp">
#include &lt;cmath&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int main() {
    double result = sqrt(25.0);
    std::cout << "The square root of 25 is " << result << std::endl;
    return 0;

                <h4>2.3 Using sqrt in Java (Math.sqrt)</h4>
                <p>In Java, the <code>Math</code> class provides a static method <code>sqrt()</code> to calculate the square root of a number.</p>
                <pre><code class="language-java">
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double result = Math.sqrt(49);
        System.out.println("The square root of 49 is " + result);
    }
}
</code></pre>
                <p>This program prints: "The square root of 49 is 7.0".</p>

                <h4>2.4 Properties of sqrt Functions</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Input Types:</strong> The <code>sqrt</code> functions typically expect a positive number. If the input is negative, they may throw an error or return NaN (Not a Number) in some languages.</li>
                    <li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> These functions provide highly accurate results, often up to 15 decimal places or more, depending on the language and platform.</li>
                    <li><strong>Performance:</strong> Using the <code>sqrt</code> function is generally the fastest method to calculate square roots, as it is optimized at the hardware level.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>2.5 Examples and Limitations</h4>
                <p>These functions are highly efficient for most use cases, but may not be ideal for symbolic calculations, handling of complex numbers, or very high precision needs. Some libraries, like Python's <code>sympy</code>, offer more advanced handling for such cases.</p>

                <pre><code class="language-python">
import sympy

# Example of symbolic square root
result = sympy.sqrt(50)
print(result)  # Output: 5*sqrt(2)
</code></pre>
                <p>This example shows how symbolic computation provides a more exact result than floating-point approximations.</p>

                <h4>2.6 Methods Behind the Logic of <code>sqrt</code> Functions</h4>
                <p>The <code>sqrt</code> functions in various programming languages are typically backed by highly efficient algorithms. Some of the common methods used behind the scenes to calculate square roots are:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Newton-Raphson Method:</strong> This iterative method refines an initial guess of the square root using the formula: $ x_{n+1} = \frac{x_n + \frac{N}{x_n}}{2} $</li>
                    <li><strong>Binary Search Method:</strong> This method works by performing binary search within a specific range to converge on the square root. The algorithm narrows down the search space based on whether the square of the midpoint is greater or smaller than the target number.</li>
                    <li><strong>Exponential and Logarithmic Approximation:</strong> Some algorithms use logarithms and exponentiation to compute the square root. This is based on the identity: $ \sqrt{N} = e^{\frac{1}{2} \ln(N)} $</li>
                    <li><strong>Fast Inverse Square Root (Quake III Algorithm):</strong> This algorithm, popularized by the Quake III game engine, approximates the inverse square root of a number, which can be used to find the square root efficiently.</li>
                    <li><strong>Continued Fractions (For Square Root Approximation):</strong> This method represents the square root as a continued fraction, allowing for efficient computation of the square root.</li>
                    <li><strong>Long Division Method:</strong> This manual algorithm, often taught for square root extraction, is analogous to long division and is used in some software to compute square roots step by step, digit by digit.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bakhshali Approximation Method:</strong> This ancient Indian method is an iterative algorithm based on an initial guess and incremental corrections, similar to Newton's method.</li>
                    <li><strong>CORDIC Algorithm:</strong> This method is used in hardware implementations like calculators or embedded systems. It computes trigonometric, hyperbolic, and square root functions using only addition, subtraction, and bit-shifting operations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Householder's Method:</strong> This is a generalization of Newton's method that converges faster by using higher-order derivatives.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Each method has its trade-offs in terms of speed, accuracy, and computational complexity, depending on the use case and hardware environment.</p>

                <h3>3. Newton-Raphson Method</h3>
                <p>The Newton-Raphson method, also called the Newton's method, or Heron's method, or the Babylonian method, or the Newton's square root method, is an iterative approach used to approximate the square root of a number. It is based on Newton's method for finding successively better approximations to the roots (or zeros) of a real-valued function.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>3.1 Conceptual Foundation</h4>
                <p>Newton-Raphson is rooted in calculus, where we use tangent lines to approximate the roots of a function. To find the square root of a number $ N $, we reformulate the problem as finding the root of the equation:</p>
                <p>$$ f(x) = x^2 - N $$</p>
                <p>The root of this equation gives us the square root of $ N $ because solving $ f(x) = 0 $ leads to $ x = \sqrt{N} $.</p>
                <p>To apply Newton's method, we use the iterative formula:</p>
                <p>$$ x_{n+1} = x_n - \frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)} $$</p>
                <p>For $ f(x) = x^2 - N $, the derivative is $ f'(x) = 2x $, so the iterative formula becomes:</p>
                <p>$$ x_{n+1} = x_n - \frac{x_n^2 - N}{2x_n} $$</p>
                <p>Simplifying the formula:</p>
                <p>$$ x_{n+1} = \frac{x_n + \frac{N}{x_n}}{2} $$</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>3.2 Iterative Process</h4>
                <p>The algorithm starts with an initial guess $ x_0 $, and then iterates the above formula until the difference between successive approximations is smaller than a predefined tolerance level, indicating convergence.</p>

                <h5>Steps for Newton-Raphson Method:</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Choose an initial guess $ x_0 $. A reasonable choice is $ x_0 = N/2 $.</li>
                    <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Apply the iterative formula:
                        $$ x_{n+1} = \frac{x_n + \frac{N}{x_n}}{2} $$
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Check the convergence condition:
                        $$ |x_{n+1} - x_n| < \epsilon $$ where $ \epsilon $ is a small tolerance value, e.g., $ 10^{-6} $. </li>
                    <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> If the convergence condition is met, $ x_{n+1} $ is the approximate square root of $ N $. Otherwise, repeat from Step 2.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>3.3 Example</h4>
                <p>Find the square root of $ N = 25 $ using the Newton-Raphson method with $ \epsilon = 10^{-6} $.</p>

                <p><strong>Step-by-step Iteration:</strong></p>

                <pre><code class="">
N = 25
x_0 = 25 / 2 = 12.5

Iteration 1:
x_1 = (12.5 + 25 / 12.5) / 2 = 7.25

Iteration 2:
x_2 = (7.25 + 25 / 7.25) / 2 = 5.349

Iteration 3:
x_3 = (5.349 + 25 / 5.349) / 2 = 5.011

Iteration 4:
x_4 = (5.011 + 25 / 5.011) / 2 = 5.000

Iteration 5:
x_5 = (5.000 + 25 / 5.000) / 2 = 5.000

Since |5.000 - 5.000| < 10^{-6}, we stop here.
</code></pre>
                <p>The approximate square root of 25 is 5.</p>

                <h3>4. Binary Search Method (with Complex Numbers)</h3>
                <p>The binary search method is a classical algorithm used to find the square root of a number by repeatedly dividing the search range into two halves. This method works well for real numbers but can also be adapted for complex numbers with certain modifications.</p>

                <p>In this method, we search for the square root by maintaining a low and high bound, then iteratively narrow down the range. The midpoint of the current range is squared, and we check whether it approximates the original number. For complex numbers, we calculate the square root in terms of its real and imaginary parts.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>4.1 Conceptual Overview</h4>
                <p>For a complex number $ z = a + bi $, where $ a $ and $ b $ are real numbers, the square root will also be a complex number of the form $ \sqrt{z} = x + yi $, where $ x $ and $ y $ are real values to be determined.</p>
                <p>The goal is to find $ x $ and $ y $ such that:</p>
                <p>$$ (x + yi)^2 = z = a + bi $$</p>
                <p>Expanding the left side gives two equations:</p>
                <p>$$ x^2 - y^2 = a $$</p>
                <p>$$ 2xy = b $$</p>
                <p>We then apply binary search on $ x $ and $ y $ within a bounded region to find the square root of the complex number.</p>

                <h4>4.2 Binary Search Algorithm for Real Numbers</h4>
                <p>Let's first review the binary search method for real numbers:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Define a range [low, high] where the square root of the number lies. For example, for a positive real number $ N $, initialize $ \text{low} = 0 $ and $ \text{high} = N $.</li>
                    <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Compute the midpoint:
                        $$ \text{mid} = \frac{\text{low} + \text{high}}{2} $$</li>
                    <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Check:
                        <ul>
                            <li>If $ \text{mid}^2 \approx N $, return $ \text{mid} $.</li>
                            <li>If $ \text{mid}^2 > N $, update the range to [low, mid].</li>
                            <li>If $ \text{mid}^2 < N $, update the range to [mid, high].</li>

                <p>For complex numbers $ z = a + bi $, we adjust the binary search to handle both the real and imaginary parts of the square root:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Start with an initial guess for the real part $ x $ and the imaginary part $ y $. Define a range for both.</li>
                    <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Compute the midpoint $ x_{\text{mid}} $ and $ y_{\text{mid}} $ for both real and imaginary parts.</li>
                    <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Calculate:
                        $$ (x_{\text{mid}} + y_{\text{mid}}i)^2 = (x_{\text{mid}}^2 - y_{\text{mid}}^2) + 2x_{\text{mid}}y_{\text{mid}}i $$
                        and compare this with $ z = a + bi $.</li>
                    <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Adjust the ranges of $ x $ and $ y $ based on whether the result is greater or smaller than the target complex number.</li>

                <h3>6. Fast Inverse Square Root</h3>
                <p>The Fast Inverse Square Root is a clever algorithm used to quickly approximate the inverse of the square root of a floating-point number. This algorithm gained fame for its use in the graphics engine of the video game *Quake III Arena*, where it helped in computing lighting and 3D transformations efficiently. The goal of the algorithm is to compute $ \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}} $ for a given number $ x $ much faster than traditional methods like the Newton-Raphson or hardware-based square root functions.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>6.1 Conceptual Overview</h4>
                <p>The Fast Inverse Square Root uses bit-level manipulation and mathematical approximations to achieve its result. The core idea behind the algorithm is to treat the floating-point number as an integer, then manipulate the bits in a way that provides a good initial guess for the inverse square root. This guess is then refined using Newton's method.</p>

                <p>The formula for the fast inverse square root is:</p>
                <p>$$ \text{invSqrt}(x) \approx \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}} $$</p>

                <p>The algorithm achieves a balance between accuracy and speed, which was crucial for real-time 3D rendering in early graphics engines.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>6.2 The Algorithm</h4>
                <p>Here is the step-by-step breakdown of the Fast Inverse Square Root algorithm:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Reinterpret the bits of the floating-point number $ x $ as an integer.</li>
                    <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Perform a bit-level operation using a "magic constant" to compute an initial guess for $ \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}} $.</li>
                    <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Use one iteration of Newton's method to refine the initial guess.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The magic constant used in the bit manipulation is often $ 0x5f3759df $, which gives a good approximation.</p>

                <p>Here is the original C code for the Fast Inverse Square Root:</p>

                <pre><code class="language-c">
float fastInverseSqrt(float x) {
    float xhalf = 0.5f * x;
    int i = *(int*)&x;           // Interpret the bits of x as an integer
    i = 0x5f3759df - (i >> 1);   // Perform the magic bit shift and subtraction
    x = *(float*)&i;             // Reinterpret the bits as a float
    x = x * (1.5f - xhalf * x * x); // One iteration of Newton's method
    return x;
}
</code></pre>
                <p>The key parts of the algorithm are the bit manipulation and the Newton-Raphson refinement step.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>6.3 Explanation of Key Steps</h4>

                <h5>6.3.1 Bit Manipulation</h5>
                <p>The reinterpretation of the floating-point number as an integer allows the algorithm to manipulate the bits directly. The magic constant $ 0x5f3759df $ helps generate a good initial approximation for the inverse square root by exploiting the structure of floating-point numbers.</p>

                <h5>6.3.2 Newton's Method Refinement</h5>
                <p>Once the initial guess is computed using bit manipulation, the algorithm uses one iteration of Newton's method to improve the accuracy. The formula for the Newton-Raphson iteration is:</p>
                <p>$$ x_{n+1} = x_n \times \left( 1.5 - \frac{x_n^2 \cdot x_{\text{input}}}{2} \right) $$</p>
                <p>This step adjusts the approximation closer to the actual inverse square root.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>6.4 Example</h4>
                <p>Let's compute the fast inverse square root of $ x = 4.0 $ using the C code described above:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Step 1: $ x = 4.0 $, so we compute $ xhalf = 0.5 \times 4.0 = 2.0 $.</li>
                    <li>Step 2: Reinterpret the bits of $ x $ as an integer. Let's assume the integer value is 0x40800000 (the IEEE-754 representation of 4.0).</li>
                    <li>Step 3: Perform the bit shift and magic constant subtraction:
                        $$ i = 0x5f3759df - \left( \frac{0x40800000}{2} \right) = 0x3f800000 $$</li>
                    <li>Step 4: Reinterpret the bits back to a float, giving an initial approximation of $ \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}} \approx 0.5 $.</li>
                    <li>Step 5: Refine the result using Newton's method:
                        $$ x = 0.5 \times \left( 1.5 - 2.0 \times 0.5^2 \right) = 0.5 \times 1.375 = 0.6875 $$</li>
                </ul>
                <p>After this single iteration, the approximation for $ \frac{1}{\sqrt{4}} $ is $ 0.6875 $, which is close to the correct value $ 0.5 $.</p>

                <p>Applying this to the code:</p>

            <article>
                <h4>7.1 Conceptual Overview</h4>
                <p>A continued fraction is a representation of a number through an infinite series of fractions. The continued fraction for the square root of $ n $ takes the form:</p>
                <p>$$ \sqrt{n} = a_0 + \cfrac{1}{a_1 + \cfrac{1}{a_2 + \cfrac{1}{a_3 + \dots}}} $$</p>
                <p>Where $ a_0, a_1, a_2, \dots $ are integers determined by the continued fraction algorithm. This sequence of integers provides progressively better approximations to the square root of $ n $.</p>

                <p>If $ n $ is a negative number, the square root will involve imaginary numbers. This is handled by converting the negative square root into a complex number.</p>

                    <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Start with an integer approximation $ a_0 = \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor $, where $ n $ is the number whose square root we seek.</li>
                    <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> For each iteration, update the values of $ m $, $ d $, and $ a $ using the recurrence relations:
                        $$ m_{n+1} = d_n a_n - m_n $$
                        $$ d_{n+1} = \frac{n - m_{n+1}^2}{d_n} $$
                        $$ a_{n+1} = \left\lfloor \frac{a_0 + m_{n+1}}{d_{n+1}} \right\rfloor $$</li>
                    <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Add each new term to the approximation of the continued fraction.</li>
                    <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> If $ n $ is negative, return the square root in the form of an imaginary number.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>This code allows us to handle both real and imaginary inputs, providing approximations to square roots through continued fractions.</p>

                <h4>7.3 Code Implementation</h4>
                <p>The following Python code implements the continued fraction method for finding square roots, with support for real and imaginary numbers:</p>

                <pre><code class="language-python">
def sqrt_continued_fraction(n, iterations=10):
    if n < 0:
        return sqrt_continued_fraction(-n, iterations) * complex(0, 1)  # sqrt(-n) is imaginary

    a0 = int(n ** 0.5)
    if a0 * a0 == n:
        return a0

    m = 0
    d = 1
    a = a0

    approx = a0
    for _ in range(iterations):
        m = d * a - m
        d = (n - m * m) // d
        a = (a0 + m) // d
        approx += 1 / a

    return approx

# Example usage
n = float(input("Enter a number you want to find square root of: "))
print(sqrt_continued_fraction(n))
</code></pre>

                <p>This code handles both real and complex square roots by checking whether $ n $ is negative. If it is, the square root is returned as an imaginary number.</p>

                <h4>7.4 Example Usage and Output</h4>
                <p>Let's say the user inputs $ n = -25 $. The code will compute the square root of $ -25 $ using continued fractions:</p>

                <pre><code class="">
Enter a number you want to find square root of: -25
5j
</code></pre>
                <p>The output is $ 5j $, which is the imaginary square root of $ -25 $. The algorithm can handle both positive and negative inputs by appropriately returning real or imaginary roots.</p>

                <h4>7.5 Applications and Limitations</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Applications:</strong> This approach is useful for approximating irrational square roots or handling complex numbers in mathematical computations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Limitations:</strong> The accuracy depends on the number of iterations, and increasing the iterations can improve the approximation. However, continued fractions may converge slowly compared to other numerical methods like Newton-Raphson.</li>
