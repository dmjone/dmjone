                <h3>Extent of a Problem</h3>
                <p>The extent of a problem refers to how widespread or significant the issue is. Understanding the extent is crucial for determining the resources and strategies needed to address it effectively.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>Factors Influencing the Extent</h4>
                <p>Several factors can influence the extent of a problem:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Scale</strong>: This involves the number of individuals, systems, or areas affected by the problem.</li>
                    <li><strong>Severity</strong>: How critical or damaging the problem is, ranging from minor inconveniences to major disruptions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Duration</strong>: The length of time the problem has persisted or is likely to continue.</li>
                    <li><strong>Complexity</strong>: The level of difficulty in understanding and solving the problem, which can affect its reach.</li>
                    <li><strong>Resources Available</strong>: The availability of tools, time, and personnel to address the problem can either limit or extend its impact.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>Assessing the Extent</h4>
                <p>Assessing the extent of a problem typically involves:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Data Collection</strong>: Gathering information on how many people or systems are affected and the nature of the impact.</li>
                    <li><strong>Analysis</strong>: Evaluating the data to determine the severity and spread of the problem.</li>
                    <li><strong>Prioritization</strong>: Deciding which aspects of the problem need immediate attention based on their impact and urgency.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>Impact on Decision-Making</h4>
                <p>The extent of a problem often guides decision-making processes. A problem that affects a large number of people or systems with significant severity will likely require more resources and a faster response compared to a minor issue with limited impact.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>Practical Example: System Outage</h4>
                <p>In a business setting, a system outage can vary in extent. If the outage affects a single department, the response might involve localized troubleshooting. However, if the entire company is impacted, the problem's extent is greater, requiring a comprehensive response involving multiple teams and possibly external support.</p>
