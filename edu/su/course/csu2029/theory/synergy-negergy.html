                <h3>1. Synergy</h3>
                <p>Synergy happens when different parts or people work together in a way that the combined effort is greater than the sum of their individual efforts. It’s like a team working together so well that they achieve more than they could if each person worked alone. The idea is that collaboration can lead to better results than working separately.</p>
            
                <h4>Case Study: Group Project</h4>
                <p>Imagine you're working on a school project with three friends. If each of you has a different skill—one is great at research, another at writing, another at designing, and the last one at presenting—and you all work together, the final project will be better than if each person did the whole thing alone. That’s synergy in action: everyone contributes their strengths, and the overall result is more impressive.</p>

            <article>
                <h3>2. Negergy</h3>
                <p>Negergy is the opposite of synergy. It occurs when the combined efforts of a group or system result in less productivity than if the parts were working independently. This can happen due to poor coordination, conflicts, or inefficiencies that drag down the overall outcome.</p>
            
                <h4>Case Study: Miscommunication in a Group</h4>
                <p>Now, imagine the same group project, but this time, there’s a lot of miscommunication. One person thinks they should do all the work, another doesn’t understand their role, and a third doesn’t agree with the project’s direction. As a result, the group argues, tasks get duplicated or left unfinished, and the final project is not as good as it could have been. This is an example of negergy, where the group’s efforts together result in less than what could have been achieved if each person had just worked alone.</p>
