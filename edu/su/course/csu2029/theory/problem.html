                <h3>Understanding a Problem</h3>
                <p>A problem is a situation where there is a difference between the current state and the desired state. It often requires a solution that addresses this gap. The nature of a problem can vary significantly, from simple to complex, and may involve different variables and constraints.</p>
            </article>

                <h4>Types of Problems</h4>
                <p>Problems can be categorized based on their characteristics:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Well-Defined Problems</strong>: These have clear goals, a defined path to the solution, and an obvious solution. An example is a mathematical equation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ill-Defined Problems</strong>: These lack a clear path or goal, making the solution more ambiguous. Real-world issues often fall into this category.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>

                <h4>Approaching a Problem</h4>
                <p>When facing a problem, it's important to identify the key elements that need to be addressed. This often involves:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Identifying the Gap</strong>: Clearly defining the difference between the current and desired states.</li>
                    <li><strong>Breaking Down the Problem</strong>: Dividing the issue into smaller, more manageable parts.</li>
                    <li><strong>Exploring Possible Solutions</strong>: Generating ideas that could bridge the gap between the current and desired states.</li>
                    <li><strong>Implementing the Solution</strong>: Choosing and applying the best possible solution to the problem.</li>
                    <li><strong>Evaluating the Outcome</strong>: Assessing whether the applied solution effectively resolves the problem.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>

                <h4>Common Challenges</h4>
                <p>Problems may present various challenges, such as limited resources, unclear objectives, or conflicting interests. Addressing these challenges often requires adaptability and creative thinking.</p>
            </article>

                <h4>Practical Example: Debugging Code</h4>
                <p>In programming, a common problem is finding and fixing errors in code. The process typically involves:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Identifying the Error</strong>: Locating where the code is not functioning as expected.</li>
                    <li><strong>Analyzing the Cause</strong>: Understanding why the error is occurring.</li>
                    <li><strong>Modifying the Code</strong>: Making changes to correct the error.</li>
                    <li><strong>Testing the Solution</strong>: Running the code to ensure the problem is fixed.</li>
                </ul>
