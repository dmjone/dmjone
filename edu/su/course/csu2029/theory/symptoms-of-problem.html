                <h3>Symptoms of a Problem</h3>
                <p>Symptoms of a problem are observable signs or indicators that suggest the presence of an issue. These symptoms often alert individuals or organizations to the need for further investigation or action.</p>

                <h4>Identifying Symptoms</h4>
                <p>Symptoms can vary widely depending on the nature of the problem. Common approaches to identifying symptoms include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Monitoring Performance</strong>: Decreased efficiency, lower output, or errors may indicate underlying issues.</li>
                    <li><strong>Observing Behavior</strong>: Changes in behavior, such as increased frustration or disengagement, can be symptoms of a problem in a team or system.</li>
                    <li><strong>Feedback</strong>: Complaints or concerns raised by users, customers, or team members often highlight symptoms of a problem.</li>
                    <li><strong>Measuring Key Indicators</strong>: Variations in key performance metrics, such as revenue, customer satisfaction, or system uptime, can signal problems.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>Examples of Problem Symptoms</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Technical Systems</strong>: Frequent crashes, slow performance, or error messages can be symptoms of a technical issue.</li>
                    <li><strong>Business Operations</strong>: Declining sales, increased customer complaints, or high employee turnover may indicate operational problems.</li>
                    <li><strong>Personal Health</strong>: Fatigue, pain, or changes in mood can be symptoms of underlying health issues.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>Addressing Symptoms vs. Causes</h4>
                <p>While symptoms are useful for identifying that a problem exists, it is crucial to distinguish between addressing the symptoms and resolving the root cause. Treating symptoms alone may provide temporary relief, but without addressing the underlying cause, the problem is likely to persist or recur.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>Practical Example: Customer Support Issues</h4>
                <p>If a company notices an increase in customer complaints about delayed shipments, the symptom is the complaints. The underlying problem might be a bottleneck in the supply chain. Addressing only the complaints (e.g., by issuing apologies) may not resolve the issue if the supply chain bottleneck is not fixed.</p>
