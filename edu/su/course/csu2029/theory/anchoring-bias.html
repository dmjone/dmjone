                <h3>Anchoring Bias</h3>
                <p>Anchoring bias is a cognitive bias where individuals rely too heavily on an initial piece of information, known as the "anchor," when making decisions. This anchor can influence subsequent judgments, even if the anchor is irrelevant or flawed.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>How Anchoring Bias Works</h4>
                <p>When making decisions or estimating values, people often start with an initial reference point (the anchor) and adjust from there. However, the adjustments are typically insufficient, causing the final decision or estimate to be biased towards the anchor.</p>
                <p>For example, if someone is asked whether the population of a city is more or less than 500,000, they might use 500,000 as an anchor when estimating the actual population, even if the real population is much higher or lower.</p>

                <h4>Examples of Anchoring Bias</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Pricing in Negotiations</strong>: During a negotiation, the first price mentioned often serves as an anchor, influencing the final agreed-upon price.</li>
                    <li><strong>Initial Offers</strong>: In salary negotiations, the first offer made can anchor the entire discussion, potentially leading to an outcome that favors one party.</li>
                    <li><strong>Judgment of Probabilities</strong>: When estimating the likelihood of events, people may anchor on initial information, even if it is not accurate, leading to biased probability assessments.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>Impact of Anchoring Bias</h4>
                <p>Anchoring bias can lead to poor decision-making because it prevents individuals from fully considering all available information. By focusing too much on the anchor, people may overlook other important factors, resulting in decisions that are not well-balanced.</p>

                <h4>Strategies to Mitigate Anchoring Bias</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Awareness</strong>: Being conscious of the presence of anchoring bias is the first step towards mitigating its impact.</li>
                    <li><strong>Deliberate Adjustment</strong>: Actively and significantly adjusting away from the anchor can help counter its influence.</li>
                    <li><strong>Seek Diverse Perspectives</strong>: Consulting multiple sources or viewpoints can reduce reliance on a single anchor.</li>
                    <li><strong>Consider Alternative Anchors</strong>: Introducing different anchors can provide a broader context and reduce the impact of the initial anchor.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Practical Example: Retail Discounts</h4>
                <p>In retail, a product may be initially priced at $200, but then marked down to $150. The original price serves as an anchor, making the discounted price seem like a great deal, even if the actual value of the product is closer to $150. Customers are influenced by the anchor price, leading them to perceive the discount as more significant than it might actually be.</p>
