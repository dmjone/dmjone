                <h3>Occam's Razor</h3>
                <p>Occam's Razor is a principle of simplicity often used in problem-solving and decision-making. It suggests that when presented with multiple competing hypotheses or explanations for a phenomenon, the simplest one—meaning the one with the fewest assumptions—should be selected.</p>

                <h4>Understanding Occam's Razor</h4>
                <p>The core idea of Occam's Razor is that unnecessary complexity should be avoided. The principle is not a rule that guarantees the simplest explanation is always correct, but rather a guideline that favors simplicity when all else is equal.</p>
                <p>For example, if you hear hoofbeats, it's more likely to be horses rather than zebras, especially in areas where horses are common and zebras are rare. This principle encourages the selection of the hypothesis that requires the fewest new assumptions.</p>

                <h4>Applications of Occam's Razor</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Scientific Research</strong>: Scientists often use Occam's Razor to choose between competing theories. The theory that explains the data with the least complexity is often preferred.</li>
                    <li><strong>Medical Diagnosis</strong>: Physicians may use this principle when diagnosing a patient, opting for the diagnosis that requires the fewest assumptions and matches the symptoms most directly.</li>
                    <li><strong>Engineering and Design</strong>: In product design, simplicity is often key. Designs that achieve the desired outcome with fewer components or steps are typically more reliable and cost-effective.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Limitations of Occam's Razor</h4>
                <p>While Occam's Razor is a useful tool, it is not infallible. The simplest explanation is not always correct. There are cases where more complex explanations are necessary to account for all the variables involved.</p>
                <p>Additionally, simplicity can be subjective; what one person considers simple, another might find complicated. Therefore, Occam's Razor should be used alongside other reasoning tools, rather than in isolation.</p>

                <h4>Practical Example: Troubleshooting a Computer</h4>
                <p>If a computer won't start, one might consider several explanations: the power supply is faulty, the motherboard is damaged, or the power cord is unplugged. According to Occam's Razor, the first step should be to check if the power cord is plugged in, as this is the simplest explanation and easiest to verify.</p>
