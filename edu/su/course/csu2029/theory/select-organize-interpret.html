            <h3>1. Select</h3>
            <p>Selecting involves choosing the most relevant information or items from a larger set. It’s like picking the best ingredients for a recipe, where you choose what’s necessary to create the dish you want. The selection process is crucial because it determines what information or resources you’ll focus on.</p>
        
            <h4>Case Study: Planning a Vacation</h4>
            <p>Imagine you’re planning a vacation. You start by selecting a destination from a list of possible places. Then, you choose the activities you want to do, like visiting a museum or going to the beach. You also pick the best time to travel based on weather and availability. This selection process helps narrow down the options to what’s most important for your trip.</p>

            <h3>2. Organize</h3>
            <p>Organizing is about arranging the selected items or information in a logical order or structure. This step makes it easier to understand or use the information. Organizing is like putting the ingredients for your recipe in the order you’ll need them or arranging your vacation itinerary so that everything fits together smoothly.</p>
        
            <h4>Case Study: Vacation Itinerary</h4>
            <p>After selecting your vacation activities, you organize them by creating a daily schedule. You decide which days you’ll go sightseeing, when you’ll relax, and how you’ll move from one place to another. This organization ensures that your vacation is well-planned and enjoyable, with each activity fitting into the overall schedule.</p>

            <h3>3. Interpret</h3>
            <p>Interpreting involves making sense of the selected and organized information. It’s about understanding what the information means and how it applies to your situation. Interpretation is like tasting your dish to see if it turned out as expected or reflecting on how your vacation plans will actually feel when you’re there.</p>
        
            <h4>Case Study: Reflecting on Your Vacation</h4>
            <p>After organizing your vacation itinerary, you interpret the plan to see if it meets your expectations. You consider whether the activities you’ve chosen will create the experience you want and whether the schedule allows for relaxation and enjoyment. This step helps you understand the impact of your choices and make any necessary adjustments before your trip.</p>
