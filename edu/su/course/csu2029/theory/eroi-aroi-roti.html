                <h3>Expected ROI vs Actual ROI vs ROTI</h3>
                <p>Understanding the difference between Expected ROI, Actual ROI, and ROTI is crucial for evaluating the success of investments and initiatives. These metrics help in assessing the financial performance and effectiveness of projects, providing insights into their profitability and impact.</p>
            </article>

                <h4>1. Expected ROI</h4>
                <p>Expected Return on Investment (ROI) is a projection of the profit or benefit that is anticipated from an investment relative to its cost. It is calculated before the investment is made, based on assumptions, forecasts, and historical data.</p>
                <pre><code class="language-auto no-code-change">Expected ROI = (Expected Gain from Investment - Cost of Investment) / Cost of Investment</code></pre>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> If a company expects to earn $120,000 from an investment that costs $100,000, the Expected ROI is:</p>
                <pre><code class="language-auto no-code-change">Expected ROI = ($120,000 - $100,000) / $100,000 = 0.20 or 20%</code></pre>
            </article>
            
            <article>
                <h4>2. Actual ROI</h4>
                <p>Actual Return on Investment (ROI) is the real profit or benefit realized from an investment, calculated after the investment has been completed or over a certain period. It reflects the true financial outcome of the investment.</p>
                <pre><code class="language-auto no-code-change">Actual ROI = (Actual Gain from Investment - Cost of Investment) / Cost of Investment</code></pre>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> If the same company ends up earning $110,000 instead of the expected $120,000, the Actual ROI is:</p>
                <pre><code class="language-auto no-code-change">Actual ROI = ($110,000 - $100,000) / $100,000 = 0.10 or 10%</code></pre>
            </article>
            
            <article>
                <h4>3. ROTI</h4>
                <p>Return on Time Invested (ROTI) is a metric that measures the value or benefit received relative to the time invested in a task, project, or activity. It is particularly useful for evaluating non-monetary investments where time is the primary resource.</p>
                <pre><code class="language-auto no-code-change">ROTI = (Perceived Value or Benefit - Time Invested) / Time Invested</code></pre>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> If a professional spends 5 hours on a task that results in significant progress or learning, the ROTI might be evaluated based on the perceived value of that progress relative to the time spent.</p>
                <p>While ROTI is often subjective, it helps in determining whether the time spent on an activity was worth the outcome achieved.</p>
            </article>
            
            <article>
                <h4>Comparing the Metrics</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Expected ROI</strong> is used for planning and decision-making before committing resources. It sets the benchmark for success.</li>
                    <li><strong>Actual ROI</strong> is used for evaluating the success of an investment after it has been completed. It shows the real financial outcome compared to the initial expectation.</li>
                    <li><strong>ROTI</strong> focuses on the efficiency and value of time spent, which is especially relevant for activities where time is the most significant resource.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Together, these metrics provide a comprehensive view of an investment's performance, helping to make informed decisions and adjustments for future projects.</p>
