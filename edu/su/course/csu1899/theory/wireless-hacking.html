                <h3>1. Types of Wireless Networks</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Wi-Fi (Wireless Fidelity)</strong>: Most common wireless network based on IEEE 802.11 standards, used in homes, businesses, and public places.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bluetooth</strong>: Short-range communication technology, often hacked when not adequately secured.</li>
                    <li><strong>Zigbee</strong>: Low-power wireless protocol, primarily for IoT devices.</li>
                    <li><strong>NFC (Near Field Communication)</strong>: Used for contactless payments, access control, and data transfer.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h3>2. Common Wireless Hacking Techniques</h3>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>2.1 Packet Sniffing</h4>
                <p><strong>Description</strong>: Packet sniffing intercepts data transmitted over a wireless network. Tools like Wireshark, Kismet, and Aircrack-ng capture unencrypted packets to extract sensitive data such as usernames, passwords, and session tokens.</p>
                <p><strong>Example</strong>: A hacker in a café can capture packets from an unsecured Wi-Fi network and steal login credentials used by customers.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>2.2 WEP/WPA/WPA2 Cracking</h4>
                <p><strong>Description</strong>: Wireless networks use protocols like WEP, WPA, and WPA2 for security, but these protocols have vulnerabilities that hackers exploit.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>WEP Cracking</strong>: WEP is insecure and can be cracked within minutes using tools like Aircrack-ng.</li>
                    <li><strong>WPA/WPA2 Cracking</strong>: WPA/WPA2 are more secure but still vulnerable to dictionary or brute-force attacks. Hackers capture the WPA handshake during a connection.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Example</strong>: Capturing the WPA handshake during a legitimate connection and using brute-force to crack the password.</p>
                <p><strong>What is WPA/WPA2?</strong></p>
                <p>WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access) was introduced in 2003 as a replacement for WEP, utilizing TKIP for encryption. WPA2 improved on this by using the AES encryption standard, making it more robust. In 2018, WPA3 was introduced with stronger protection, though its adoption is still limited.</p>

            <article>
                <h4>2.3 Rogue Access Points (Evil Twin Attack)</h4>
                <p><strong>Description</strong>: A hacker sets up a fake access point to mimic a legitimate network. Users unknowingly connect to it, allowing the hacker to intercept all transmitted data.</p>
                <p><strong>Example</strong>: A hacker creates a "Free Wi-Fi" access point in a public area to trick users into connecting.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>2.4 Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks</h4>
                <p><strong>Description</strong>: Hackers intercept communication between the client and the access point to eavesdrop, steal data, or inject malicious content.</p>
                <p><strong>Example</strong>: A hacker in a coffee shop intercepts traffic between a user and the Wi-Fi router to steal financial information.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>2.5 Deauthentication Attacks</h4>
                <p><strong>Description</strong>: Hackers send forged deauthentication frames to disconnect clients from the network, often to capture the WPA handshake or disrupt services.</p>
                <p><strong>Example</strong>: Sending deauthentication packets in a hotel Wi-Fi network to force users onto a rogue access point.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>2.6 Wi-Fi Phishing</h4>
                <p><strong>Description</strong>: A social engineering attack where hackers create a fake login page for a wireless network to steal user credentials.</p>
                <p><strong>Example</strong>: A hacker sets up a fake corporate Wi-Fi login page, tricking employees into entering their credentials.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>2.7 Bluetooth Hacking</h4>
                <p><strong>Description</strong>: Exploiting vulnerabilities in Bluetooth devices to access data or control devices.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Bluejacking</strong>: Sending unsolicited messages to Bluetooth devices.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bluesnarfing</strong>: Unauthorized access to a device's data.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bluebugging</strong>: Taking control of Bluetooth-enabled devices to make calls or access data.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Example</strong>: Using Bluesnarfing to access a user’s contact list and messages without their knowledge.</p>
