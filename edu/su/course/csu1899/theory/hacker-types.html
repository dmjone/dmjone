                <h4>Introduction to Hackers</h4>
                <p>A hacker is an individual who uses their technical knowledge and skills to manipulate computer systems, networks, or software to achieve a goal. This goal can vary widely, ranging from malicious activities like stealing sensitive information to benevolent actions like finding and fixing security vulnerabilities. The term "hacker" has evolved over time and can encompass a broad spectrum of activities and intentions.</p>

                <h4>Types of Hackers</h4>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>White Hat Hackers</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Definition</strong>: White hat hackers, also known as ethical hackers, are professionals who use their hacking skills for legal and constructive purposes. They are often employed by organizations to test and secure their systems.</li>
                            <li><strong>Purpose</strong>: The primary goal of white hat hackers is to identify vulnerabilities in systems, applications, and networks before malicious hackers can exploit them.</li>
                            <li><strong>Activities</strong>: They conduct penetration testing, vulnerability assessments, and security audits. Their work helps organizations enhance their cybersecurity defenses.</li>
                            <li><strong>Ethics</strong>: White hat hackers operate under strict ethical guidelines, ensuring they have permission to test the systems they are working on.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Black Hat Hackers</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Definition</strong>: Black hat hackers are individuals who engage in hacking for malicious purposes, often for personal gain or to cause harm. They are the "bad guys" in the hacking world.</li>
                            <li><strong>Purpose</strong>: Their goals can include stealing sensitive information, spreading malware, disrupting services, and causing financial or reputational damage.</li>
                            <li><strong>Activities</strong>: Black hat hackers may engage in activities like phishing, distributing ransomware, identity theft, and other forms of cybercrime.</li>
                            <li><strong>Ethics</strong>: Unlike white hat hackers, black hat hackers operate outside the bounds of the law and ethical standards. Their activities are illegal and punishable by law.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Gray Hat Hackers</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Definition</strong>: Gray hat hackers fall somewhere between white hat and black hat hackers. They may exploit vulnerabilities in systems without permission but often report these issues to the system's owner afterward.</li>
                            <li><strong>Purpose</strong>: Gray hat hackers may not have malicious intent but may act without authorization. Their actions can be driven by curiosity, the challenge of hacking, or a desire to demonstrate security flaws.</li>
                            <li><strong>Activities</strong>: They might discover vulnerabilities in a system and inform the organization, sometimes requesting payment for their findings. While their actions may result in positive outcomes, they operate in a legal and ethical gray area.</li>
                            <li><strong>Ethics</strong>: The ethics of gray hat hackers are ambiguous. While they may not seek to cause harm, their lack of permission can lead to unintended consequences.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Script Kiddies</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Definition</strong>: Script kiddies are inexperienced or unskilled hackers who use pre-written scripts or tools developed by others to carry out attacks. They lack deep technical knowledge and rely on automated tools.</li>
                            <li><strong>Purpose</strong>: Often motivated by the thrill of hacking or a desire to cause mischief, script kiddies may engage in hacking to gain notoriety or simply for fun.</li>
                            <li><strong>Activities</strong>: They typically use tools to conduct simple attacks, such as defacing websites, launching DDoS attacks, or exploiting known vulnerabilities.</li>
                            <li><strong>Ethics</strong>: Script kiddies often lack a clear understanding of the ethical implications of their actions and may engage in illegal activities without fully realizing the consequences.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Hacktivists</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Definition</strong>: Hacktivists are hackers who use their skills to promote political, social, or ideological agendas. They combine hacking with activism.</li>
                            <li><strong>Purpose</strong>: Their goal is often to draw attention to a cause, protest against perceived injustices, or disrupt the operations of organizations they oppose.</li>
                            <li><strong>Activities</strong>: Hacktivists may deface websites, leak sensitive information, or launch cyberattacks to support their cause. Notable hacktivist groups include Anonymous and LulzSec.</li>
                            <li><strong>Ethics</strong>: The ethical standing of hacktivists is contentious. While they may believe they are fighting for a just cause, their methods often involve illegal activities.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Nation-State Hackers</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Definition</strong>: Nation-state hackers are highly skilled hackers employed or sponsored by governments to conduct cyber espionage, cyber warfare, and sabotage against other nations or organizations.</li>

                            <li><strong>Ethics</strong>: The actions of nation-state hackers are driven by geopolitical objectives rather than personal ethics. While legal within their own country, their activities are considered illegal by the targeted nations.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Cybercriminals</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Definition</strong>: Cybercriminals are individuals or groups who use hacking for financial gain. They engage in activities such as fraud, theft, and extortion in the digital space.</li>
                            <li><strong>Purpose</strong>: Their primary goal is to make money, whether through stealing credit card information, launching ransomware attacks, or running online scams.</li>
                            <li><strong>Activities</strong>: Cybercriminals may operate on the dark web, selling stolen data, malware, or hacking services. They are involved in phishing campaigns, identity theft, and other forms of online fraud.</li>
