                <h3>1. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) & Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)</h3>
                <p>In the context of Ethical Hacking, understanding IDS and IPS is essential as they are critical components of network security. These systems monitor network traffic for malicious activity and provide different ways to respond to potential threats.</p>
            </article>
            
            <article>
                <h4>1.1 Intrusion Detection System (IDS)</h4>
            
                <h5>1.1.1 Definition</h5>
                <p>An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a device or software application that monitors a network or systems for malicious activity, policy violations, or unauthorized access. IDS analyzes network packets, system logs, or file changes and reports any suspicious behavior to the network administrator.</p>
            
                <h5>1.1.2 How It Works</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Network-Based IDS (NIDS)</strong>: This monitors entire network traffic and detects attacks by capturing network traffic and analyzing packet data. Examples include systems placed at key points within a network.</li>
                    <li><strong>Host-Based IDS (HIDS)</strong>: This is installed on individual hosts or devices to monitor activities such as file integrity, processes, and system logs for signs of malicious activity.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>IDS does not block or prevent attacks but alerts the security team or generates a log of the suspicious activity.</p>
            
                <h5>1.1.3 What It Does</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Detection of Known Attacks</strong>: IDS uses predefined signatures of known malicious patterns (signature-based detection) to flag potential threats.</li>
                    <li><strong>Anomaly Detection</strong>: IDS also uses baseline data to detect any abnormal behavior (anomaly-based detection) that may indicate an attack.</li>
                    <li><strong>Alerting & Logging</strong>: IDS generates alerts and logs of suspicious traffic or activities. These alerts help administrators take immediate action to prevent damage.</li>
                </ul>
            
                <h5>1.1.4 Advantages</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Increased Awareness</strong>: Provides administrators with valuable insights into potential threats.</li>
                    <li><strong>Logs & Reports</strong>: Helps collect data for forensic analysis after an attack.</li>
                    <li><strong>Minimal Impact on Performance</strong>: IDS systems usually do not slow down network performance since they only monitor traffic, without taking any action.</li>
                </ul>
            
                <h5>1.1.5 Disadvantages</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>No Preventive Action</strong>: IDS only monitors and alerts; it does not stop attacks.</li>
                    <li><strong>False Positives</strong>: IDS can sometimes generate false alarms, requiring administrators to sift through unnecessary alerts.</li>
                    <li><strong>Requires Monitoring</strong>: Continuous monitoring and a response team are essential to react to alerts.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>1.2 Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)</h4>
            
                <h5>1.2.1 Definition</h5>
                <p>An Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) is a network security system that actively monitors network traffic and takes immediate action to prevent attacks. IPS not only detects potential threats but also blocks or prevents them in real time.</p>
            
                <h5>1.2.2 How It Works</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Inline with Traffic</strong>: Unlike IDS, an IPS is deployed inline with the network traffic, meaning it actively intercepts and filters traffic between source and destination.</li>
                    <li><strong>Prevention Mechanisms</strong>: When an IPS detects malicious activity, it can block the traffic, reset connections, or reconfigure firewall rules to prevent further attempts.</li>
                    <li><strong>Signature-Based and Anomaly-Based Detection</strong>: IPS can use both signature-based detection (identifying known threats) and anomaly-based detection (flagging abnormal behavior).</li>
                </ul>
            
                <h5>1.2.3 What It Does</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Blocking Attacks</strong>: IPS can stop attacks as they happen by dropping malicious packets or blocking suspicious IP addresses.</li>
                    <li><strong>Resetting Connections</strong>: If an attack is detected, IPS can reset a connection between the attacker and the target to halt the attack.</li>
                    <li><strong>Firewall Rule Updates</strong>: Some IPS systems can dynamically update firewall rules to block incoming malicious traffic.</li>
                </ul>
            
                <h5>1.2.4 Advantages</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Proactive Defense</strong>: IPS provides real-time protection by automatically blocking or mitigating attacks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reduces Response Time</strong>: Since IPS systems act automatically, they significantly reduce the time needed to respond to a potential attack.</li>
                    <li><strong>Improved Security Posture</strong>: By blocking threats before they cause damage, IPS can significantly improve overall network security.</li>
                </ul>
            
                <h5>1.2.5 Disadvantages</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Can Impact Network Performance</strong>: Since IPS systems are deployed inline, they can cause network latency if not properly optimized.</li>
                    <li><strong>False Positives</strong>: Like IDS, IPS may incorrectly block legitimate traffic, impacting normal business operations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Complex Configuration</strong>: Properly configuring an IPS to avoid false positives and ensure performance can be complex.</li>
                </ul>
