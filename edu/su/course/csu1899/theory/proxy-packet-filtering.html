                <h4>1. Proxy Servers</h4>
                <p><strong>Definition:</strong> A proxy server acts as an intermediary between a client and the internet. It receives requests from a client (such as a web browser), forwards them to the appropriate server, and then returns the server’s response to the client. It hides the client's IP address, providing anonymity, and can also control internet traffic to block malicious content.</p>
            
                <h5>Types of Proxy Servers:</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Forward Proxy:</strong> Forwards client requests to any server on the internet. Commonly used in internal networks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reverse Proxy:</strong> Routes requests coming from the internet to appropriate servers within a network. Used for load balancing, caching, and improving security.</li>
                    <li><strong>Transparent Proxy:</strong> Identifies itself as a proxy server and makes the original IP address available through request headers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Anonymous Proxy:</strong> Hides the user’s IP address but identifies itself as a proxy.</li>
                    <li><strong>High-Anonymity Proxy:</strong> Completely hides both the user’s identity and the fact that the request is being routed through a proxy.</li>
                </ul>
            
                <h5>Functions of Proxy Servers:</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Security:</strong> A proxy can filter unwanted content, block malicious websites, and prevent unauthorized access.</li>
                    <li><strong>Caching:</strong> Proxies store copies of frequently requested resources, reducing bandwidth and speeding up access.</li>
                    <li><strong>Access Control:</strong> Organizations use proxies to control employee access to websites, limiting non-work-related traffic.</li>
                    <li><strong>Anonymity and Privacy:</strong> A proxy hides the user’s IP address, allowing anonymous browsing.</li>
                </ul>
            
                <h5>Example:</h5>
                <p>A student browsing a website through a proxy server. When they request to visit a website, the proxy intercepts the request, forwards it to the website, and returns the data. The website sees the proxy's IP address, not the student’s, ensuring privacy.</p>
            
                <h5>Case Study (India):</h5>
                <p><strong>Proxy Servers for Internet Censorship:</strong> In India, certain websites are blocked due to government regulations or court orders. Users often use proxy servers to bypass these blocks. For example, during certain periods, the government blocks access to torrent websites. Proxy servers are used by individuals to access the content despite the ban.</p>

                <h4>2. Packet Filtering</h4>
                <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Packet filtering is a network security technique that controls data flow to and from a network by monitoring incoming and outgoing packets. Each packet is examined, and if it does not meet predefined rules, it is either allowed or blocked. This is typically done using firewalls.</p>
            
                <h5>How Packet Filtering Works:</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Header Examination:</strong> Packet filters inspect the headers of packets for specific characteristics like source IP, destination IP, protocol (TCP, UDP), and port numbers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Rules-based Decision Making:</strong> Filters use predefined rules to determine whether a packet should be allowed through or blocked. These rules may include blocking traffic from specific IP addresses, allowing only certain traffic types (e.g., HTTP or HTTPS), or filtering based on port numbers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Stateless vs. Stateful Packet Filtering:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Stateless:</strong> Treats every packet independently without tracking past interactions or connection states.</li>
                            <li><strong>Stateful:</strong> Tracks ongoing conversations (sessions) and makes decisions based on the context of previous packets in the session.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            
                <h5>Advantages of Packet Filtering:</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Lightweight traffic management by inspecting only packet headers, making it less resource-intensive.</li>
                    <li><strong>Security:</strong> Helps block malicious traffic and restrict access to the network.</li>
                    <li><strong>Implementation:</strong> Easily implemented on routers and other network devices.</li>
                </ul>
            
                <h5>Disadvantages:</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Limited Inspection:</strong> Packet filters only inspect headers, not the data payloads.</li>
                    <li><strong>Complexity:</strong> Managing a comprehensive set of filtering rules can become complex in larger networks.</li>
                </ul>
            
                <h5>Example:</h5>
                <p>In a university setting, a firewall using packet filtering can block students from accessing certain websites or online games during study hours. The firewall inspects incoming and outgoing packets and ensures that only traffic from academic websites is allowed.</p>
            
                <h5>Case Study (India):</h5>
                <p><strong>Packet Filtering in Indian ISPs:</strong> Indian ISPs implement packet filtering to comply with government regulations. For example, during political unrest or exam leaks, ISPs block access to social media platforms or messaging apps. Packet filtering prevents packets with destination addresses associated with these platforms from reaching users.</p>
