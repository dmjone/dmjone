                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Penetration Testing (Pen Testing)</strong>: The practice of simulating cyber attacks on a system, network, or application to identify and address security vulnerabilities. Penetration testing helps organizations understand their security posture and strengthen their defenses.</li>
                    <li><strong>Vulnerability Assessment</strong>: A systematic process to identify, classify, and prioritize vulnerabilities within a system or network. It involves scanning for potential weaknesses but does not include the exploitation of these vulnerabilities.</li>
                    <li><strong>Exploit</strong>: A piece of software, script, or command that takes advantage of a vulnerability in a system to perform unauthorized actions, such as accessing data or taking control of the system.</li>
                    <li><strong>Payload</strong>: The part of an exploit that carries out the intended malicious action, such as executing a command or installing malware. In ethical hacking, payloads are used to test the effectiveness of security measures.</li>
                    <li><strong>Social Engineering</strong>: A technique used to manipulate individuals into divulging confidential information or performing actions that compromise security. Social engineering can involve phishing emails, pretexting, or baiting.</li>
                    <li><strong>Phishing</strong>: A type of social engineering attack where attackers send fraudulent emails or messages that appear to be from legitimate sources to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information or clicking on malicious links.</li>
                    <li><strong>Firewall</strong>: A network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. Firewalls help prevent unauthorized access to or from a private network.</li>
                    <li><strong>Intrusion Detection System (IDS)</strong>: A device or software application that monitors network or system activities for malicious activities or policy violations. IDS can detect and alert administrators about potential security breaches.</li>
                    <li><strong>Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)</strong>: A network security solution that not only detects but also prevents identified threats by blocking or rejecting malicious traffic.</li>
                    <li><strong>Zero-Day Vulnerability</strong>: A security flaw that is unknown to the software vendor or the public and is exploited by attackers before a patch or fix is available.</li>
                </ol>
