                <h3>1. Introduction to P2P Systems</h3>
                <p>Peer-to-peer (P2P) systems are distributed systems where nodes, also called peers, directly interact with each other to share resources such as files, processing power, or network bandwidth. Unlike traditional client-server models, P2P systems are decentralized, enabling greater scalability and fault tolerance.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Key Features:</strong> Decentralization, resource sharing, scalability, and fault tolerance.</li>
                    <li><strong>Applications:</strong> File sharing (e.g., BitTorrent), streaming (e.g., Spotify), and distributed computing (e.g., SETI@Home).</li>
                </ul>
            </article>


            <article>
                <h3>2. Architecture of P2P Systems</h3>

                <article>
                    <h4>2.1 Pure P2P Systems</h4>
                    <p><strong>What:</strong> Decentralized systems where all peers have equal roles and responsibilities. No single node has control over the network.</p>
                    <p><strong>How:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Each peer acts as both a client and a server, sharing resources and responsibilities.</li>
                        <li>Network topology is unstructured, typically forming a graph where peers connect randomly.</li>
                        <li>Searches involve flooding queries across the network with a Time-To-Live (TTL) restriction, as seen in Gnutella.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Why:</strong> To eliminate single points of failure and distribute all responsibilities equally among peers, making the system highly resilient to node failures.</p>
                </article>

                <article>
                    <h4>2.2 Hybrid P2P Systems</h4>
                    <p><strong>What:</strong> Systems where some nodes take on additional roles for coordination, indexing, or routing, while others function as regular peers.</p>
                    <p><strong>How:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Supernodes are introduced as high-capacity peers that store metadata or directory information (e.g., in FastTrack).</li>
                        <li>Regular peers connect to supernodes for tasks like search and discovery instead of broadcasting queries across the network.</li>
                        <li>Supernode selection is often based on metrics like availability, bandwidth, or reputation.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Why:</strong> To improve efficiency by reducing overhead from flooding and to enable scalable coordination in networks with many peers.</p>
                </article>

                <article>
                    <h4>2.3 Structured P2P Systems</h4>
                    <p><strong>What:</strong> Systems where nodes organize themselves into a predefined topology, such as a ring, tree, or hypercube, often employing Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs) for data storage and retrieval.</p>
                    <p><strong>How:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Nodes are assigned unique IDs, often derived from a consistent hashing algorithm.</li>
                        <li>Keys and data are mapped to specific nodes based on their IDs, ensuring efficient data placement and retrieval.</li>
                        <li>Routing is performed using deterministic algorithms that exploit the structured topology, achieving logarithmic lookup times (e.g., Chord uses finger tables, Pastry employs prefix-based routing).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Why:</strong> To ensure efficient search and resource lookup, reduce overhead, and enable scalability by optimizing query routing and minimizing redundant communication.</p>
                </article>

                <h3>3. Key Concepts in P2P Systems</h3>

                <article>
                    <h4>3.1 Overlay Networks</h4>
                    <p><strong>What:</strong> Logical networks built on top of physical networks, where connections between nodes are determined by application-specific requirements rather than physical proximity.</p>
                    <p><strong>How:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Nodes communicate using a set of protocols designed for the overlay (e.g., TCP or UDP).</li>
                        <li>The network topology (e.g., ring, mesh, or tree) is abstracted from the underlying physical network.</li>
                        <li>Each node maintains a list of its logical neighbors as defined by the overlay structure.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Why:</strong> To facilitate efficient communication and functionality specific to the application, independent of the physical network’s constraints, such as geographical distribution or routing mechanisms.</p>
                </article>

                <article>
                    <h4>3.2 Distributed Hash Tables (DHT)</h4>
                    <p><strong>What:</strong> A decentralized data storage system that maps keys to values, enabling efficient storage and retrieval operations across a distributed network.</p>
                    <p><strong>How:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Each node is assigned a unique identifier, typically generated using a hash function.</li>
                        <li>Keys are also hashed into the same identifier space, and data is stored at the node with an ID closest to the key.</li>
                        <li>Examples include Chord (uses consistent hashing for efficient routing), Pastry (uses prefix-based routing), and Kelips (minimizes lookup time by extensive replication).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Why:</strong> To ensure scalability, fault tolerance, and efficient lookup operations in distributed systems, making DHTs ideal for dynamic networks like P2P.</p>
                </article>

                <article>
                    <h4>3.3 Consistent Hashing</h4>
                    <p><strong>What:</strong> A hashing technique that evenly distributes keys across nodes, mitigating load imbalance and providing resilience to node additions or removals.</p>
                    <p><strong>How:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Nodes and keys are hashed into a circular identifier space (e.g., 0 to \(2^m - 1\)).</li>
                        <li>A key is stored at the first node with an ID greater than or equal to the key’s hash value (modulo the identifier space size).</li>
                        <li>When nodes join or leave, only keys in the affected region of the identifier space need to be reassigned, minimizing disruption.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Why:</strong> To provide scalable and efficient key-value mappings in a distributed environment, ensuring minimal redistribution of data during node changes.</p>
                </article>

                <article>
                    <h4>3.4 Churn</h4>
                    <p><strong>What:</strong> The rate at which nodes join, leave, or fail within a P2P network, a critical factor impacting stability and performance.</p>
                    <p><strong>How:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Churn affects the maintenance of routing tables and data replication, requiring periodic updates or stabilization protocols.</li>
                        <li>Mechanisms like redundancy (e.g., multiple successors in Chord) and gossip-based membership protocols (e.g., in Kelips) are employed to handle churn.</li>
                        <li>Dynamic networks maintain neighbor lists or finger tables to adapt to changes caused by churn.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Why:</strong> To ensure system reliability and operational continuity despite frequent node changes, which are inherent in large-scale, decentralized networks.</p>
                </article>

                <h3>4. Widely-Deployed P2P Systems</h3>

                <article>
                    <h4>4.1 Napster</h4>
                    <p><strong>What:</strong> A centralized peer-to-peer (P2P) system where metadata is stored on central servers while files remain on peers. It was primarily used for music sharing.</p>
                    <p><strong>How:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Users uploaded a list of shared files to a central Napster server upon connecting.</li>
                        <li>The server maintained a directory of metadata in tuples: &lt;filename, IP address, port&gt;.</li>
                        <li>Searches were executed by querying the central server, which returned potential sources.</li>
                        <li>File transfer occurred directly between peers using TCP.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Why:</strong> To simplify file sharing by centralizing search functionality, making it fast and user-friendly. This structure also minimized redundancy in queries and reduced the burden on peers.</p>
                </article>

                <article>
                    <h4>4.2 Gnutella</h4>
                    <p><strong>What:</strong> A fully decentralized P2P system where every peer acted as both client and server ("servent"). It eliminated central servers and used an overlay network for communication.</p>
                    <p><strong>How:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Peers were connected in a graph-like overlay network.</li>
                        <li>Searches used flooding, where a query propagated to all neighbors up to a Time-To-Live (TTL) limit.</li>
                        <li>Responses (QueryHits) were routed back along the reverse path of the query.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Why:</strong> To remove the reliance on central servers, reducing the risk of a single point of failure and legal vulnerabilities like those faced by Napster.</p>
                </article>

                <article>
                    <h4>4.3 FastTrack</h4>
                    <p><strong>What:</strong> A hybrid P2P system combining features of Napster and Gnutella, using "supernodes" for metadata indexing and search.</p>
                    <p><strong>How:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Supernodes, designated from high-reputation peers, indexed and managed directory information for their nearby peers.</li>
                        <li>Regular peers connected to supernodes for queries instead of flooding the entire network.</li>
                        <li>Supernodes periodically updated their neighbor lists to adapt to network changes.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Why:</strong> To improve the efficiency of search operations and reduce the overhead of query flooding seen in Gnutella.</p>
                </article>

                <article>
                    <h4>4.4 BitTorrent</h4>
                    <p><strong>What:</strong> A P2P protocol optimized for file distribution by dividing files into blocks and incentivizing cooperative sharing.</p>
                    <p><strong>How:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Files were split into blocks, and each block was shared independently.</li>
                        <li>Trackers provided lists of peers who had parts of the file.</li>
                        <li>Peers used the "Local Rarest First" policy to prioritize downloading rare blocks from their neighbors.</li>
                        <li>Implemented a tit-for-tat strategy, ensuring peers only downloaded if they contributed upload bandwidth.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Why:</strong> To maximize download speeds and ensure resource fairness by encouraging participation through tit-for-tat incentives.</p>

                <article>
                    <h4>5.1 Chord</h4>
                    <p><strong>What:</strong> A structured P2P system using consistent hashing to organize peers and keys in a virtual circular space, known as a ring. It ensures efficient search and lookup operations.</p>
                    <p><strong>How:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Each peer and key is hashed onto the ring using a consistent hashing function.</li>
                        <li>Peers maintain routing information in finger tables, where each entry points to a peer at a distance of \(2^i\) positions ahead.</li>
                        <li>Search involves forwarding queries to the peer closest to the target key in \(O(\log N)\) hops.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Why:</strong> To ensure efficient and scalable resource location and to handle dynamic peer join and leave events gracefully with minimal disruption.</p>
                </article>

                <article>
                    <h4>5.2 Pastry</h4>
                    <p><strong>What:</strong> A structured P2P system that routes messages based on prefix matching and accounts for the underlying network topology to optimize routing paths.</p>
                    <p><strong>How:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Each peer is assigned an ID, and keys are hashed into the same space.</li>
                        <li>Peers maintain routing tables, where entries are organized by matching prefixes.</li>
                        <li>Routing involves forwarding messages to the peer with the longest matching prefix, achieving \(O(\log N)\) hops.</li>
                        <li>Topology awareness ensures that early routing hops occur between geographically closer peers.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Why:</strong> To achieve efficient message routing while minimizing latency by leveraging locality in the underlying physical network.</p>
                </article>

                <article>
                    <h4>5.3 Kelips</h4>
                    <p><strong>What:</strong> A structured P2P system designed to minimize lookup costs to \(O(1)\) by extensively replicating metadata within affinity groups.</p>
                    <p><strong>How:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The system divides peers into \(k = \sqrt{N}\) affinity groups, with each peer belonging to one group.</li>
                        <li>Each affinity group replicates metadata for all files that hash to it, decoupling metadata from file storage.</li>
                        <li>Peers maintain pointers to all members of their group and a single contact for each other group.</li>
                        <li>Lookups involve querying the contact for the target group, achieving \(O(1)\) hops in the best case.</li>
                    </ul>

                <article>
                    <h4>10.1 Freeloading</h4>
                    <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Freeloading occurs when some peers in a P2P system only download resources without sharing their own, leading to an imbalance and reduced system efficiency.</p>
                    <p><strong>Solutions:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Reputation Systems:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Peers earn reputation points based on their contributions (e.g., FastTrack's participation level). High reputation enables better service, such as faster downloads.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Tit-for-Tat Policy:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Used in BitTorrent to ensure mutual cooperation. Peers prioritize uploading to those who reciprocate with high download speeds.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Why:</strong> Incentivizing contributions ensures fair resource sharing and improves the overall health of the network by discouraging freeloading behavior.</p>

                                <li>High-capacity nodes take on additional responsibilities, such as managing metadata and coordinating search queries (e.g., FastTrack). This reduces the load on regular peers.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Structured Overlays:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Systems like Chord and Pastry use structured overlays with logarithmic scaling for routing and lookup operations, ensuring efficiency as the network grows.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Why:</strong> Structured designs and role differentiation enable the system to handle larger networks without significant performance degradation.</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Encrypt metadata and file transfers to protect against interception and unauthorized access.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Digital Signatures:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Use digital signatures to verify the authenticity of files and prevent content poisoning or tampering.</li>

                <h4>13.1 Difference Between Napster and Gnutella File Search Mechanisms</h4>
                <p><strong>Napster:</strong> Centralized Search</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>How it works:</strong> Napster uses a centralized server to store directory information about all shared files in the network.</li>
                    <li><strong>Process:</strong>
                        <ol>
                            <li>When a client searches for a file, the query is sent to the server.</li>
                            <li>The server searches its directory and returns a list of peers that host the requested file.</li>
                            <li>The client then directly connects to a peer to download the file.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Characteristics:</strong> Fast, efficient, but relies on the central server, making it a single point of failure.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Gnutella:</strong> Decentralized Search</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>How it works:</strong> Gnutella uses a fully decentralized approach where every peer participates in search and retrieval.</li>
                    <li><strong>Process:</strong>
                        <ol>
                            <li>When a client searches for a file, it sends a query to its directly connected neighbors.</li>
                            <li>Neighbors forward the query to their neighbors in a process called flooding, subject to a Time-To-Live (TTL) limit.</li>
                            <li>Peers that have the requested file respond with a QueryHit message, routed back to the querying peer.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Characteristics:</strong> No central dependency, resilient to node failures, but inefficient due to high query overhead.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Key Differences:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Napster relies on a centralized server, while Gnutella is fully decentralized.</li>
                    <li>Napster’s search is efficient and fast, whereas Gnutella’s flooding results in high overhead and redundant messages.</li>
                    <li>Gnutella avoids single points of failure, making it more fault-tolerant compared to Napster.</li>

                <p><strong>Gnutella:</strong> Fully Decentralized Peer-to-Peer System</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>How it works:</strong> Every peer (called a "servent") acts as both a client and a server, forming a fully decentralized network.</li>
                    <li><strong>Search Process:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Search queries are flooded to all neighbors up to a Time-To-Live (TTL) limit.</li>
                            <li>Peers that have the requested file respond with QueryHit messages, routed back to the source.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>FastTrack:</strong> Hybrid Peer-to-Peer System</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>How it works:</strong> A hybrid system where some nodes, called supernodes, are given additional responsibilities to store metadata and handle queries for nearby peers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Search Process:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Regular peers send queries to their supernode, which searches its directory of metadata.</li>
                            <li>Supernodes forward queries to other supernodes as needed.</li>
                            <li>Once a match is found, the result is returned to the querying peer.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Advantages:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Efficient search as it avoids flooding and uses supernodes for query handling.</li>
                            <li>Scalable design supports larger networks than Gnutella.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Disadvantages:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Relies on supernodes, which can become points of failure if not managed properly.</li>
                            <li>More complex to implement than fully decentralized systems like Gnutella.</li>
                        </ul>

                <h4>13.3 BitTorrent’s Tit-for-Tat Mechanism</h4>

                <p><strong>What:</strong> A bandwidth-sharing strategy used in BitTorrent to incentivize peers to share file blocks, ensuring mutual cooperation among participants in the network.</p>

                <p><strong>How:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Peer Interaction:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Each peer connects to multiple other peers in the swarm.</li>
                            <li>Peers prioritize uploading blocks to those neighbors that provide the best download speeds.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Optimistic Unchoking:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Periodically, a random neighbor is “unchoked” (allowed to download) regardless of its past contribution.</li>
                            <li>This ensures new peers have a chance to participate and contribute to the swarm.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Choking:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Limits the number of peers a node uploads to at any given time, typically focusing on a small set of “best” peers.</li>
                            <li>Peers that do not reciprocate effectively are “choked” (denied uploads).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Why:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Encourages Contribution:</strong> Tit-for-tat rewards peers who upload, discouraging freeloading behavior (peers only downloading without uploading).</li>
                    <li><strong>Efficient Resource Use:</strong> By prioritizing high-speed connections, it ensures faster file distribution and efficient use of bandwidth.</li>
                    <li><strong>Resilience to Churn:</strong> Optimistic unchoking helps integrate new peers and prevents deadlocks, ensuring swarm stability.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Key Characteristics:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Self-enforcing mechanism: Peers are motivated to cooperate without requiring external enforcement.</li>
                    <li>Adaptable to dynamic conditions: Adjusts to changing peer behavior and network conditions in real-time.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> BitTorrent’s tit-for-tat mechanism ensures fair bandwidth sharing by prioritizing uploads to cooperative peers while incorporating randomness to give new peers a chance to contribute.</p>

                <h4>13.4 What is Consistent Hashing?</h4>

                <p><strong>What:</strong> Consistent hashing is a technique used in distributed systems to evenly distribute data (keys) across nodes, ensuring minimal disruption when nodes are added or removed from the system.</p>

                <p><strong>How:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Hashing Nodes and Keys:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Both nodes (e.g., servers) and keys (e.g., data identifiers) are hashed into the same circular identifier space (e.g., \(0\) to \(2^m - 1\)).</li>
                            <li>Each key is assigned to the first node with an identifier greater than or equal to the key's hash value (modulo the identifier space size).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Node Join and Leave:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>When a new node joins, it only takes responsibility for keys within its range, minimizing data reassignment.</li>
                            <li>When a node leaves, its keys are redistributed to the next node in the ring.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Load Balancing:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>To avoid uneven distribution, virtual nodes (multiple hashed IDs per physical node) are often used, balancing the load across nodes.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Why:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> As the number of nodes changes, consistent hashing minimizes the amount of data that needs to be reassigned, reducing overhead.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fault Tolerance:</strong> Ensures that data remains accessible even if some nodes fail, by redistributing keys to neighboring nodes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> The deterministic placement of keys allows for efficient lookup operations, often logarithmic in the number of nodes.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Key Characteristics:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Node addition/removal only affects the keys in the immediate neighborhood of the node.</li>
                    <li>Used in distributed hash tables (DHTs) like Chord and storage systems like Amazon DynamoDB.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Consistent hashing ensures efficient, scalable, and fault-tolerant data distribution in dynamic distributed systems, making it a cornerstone for modern distributed architectures.</p>

            <article>
                <h4>13.5 Why Are Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs) Efficient in Searching?</h4>

                <p><strong>What:</strong> DHTs are decentralized systems that map keys to nodes in a network, enabling efficient lookup operations by leveraging structured topologies and deterministic routing mechanisms.</p>

                <p><strong>How:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Key-to-Node Mapping:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Each key is hashed into a specific space, and the key is assigned to a responsible node using consistent hashing or similar algorithms.</li>
                            <li>This deterministic mapping eliminates the need for exhaustive searching.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Structured Topologies:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Nodes organize themselves into structured overlays like rings (e.g., Chord), trees (e.g., Pastry), or affinity groups (e.g., Kelips).</li>
                            <li>The structured nature of these overlays allows for targeted routing rather than flooding queries across the network.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Efficient Routing:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Each node maintains a routing table that allows queries to progress closer to the target in logarithmic steps (\(O(\log N)\) for systems like Chord and Pastry).</li>
                            <li>Advanced systems like Kelips further reduce lookup times to \(O(1)\) by replicating metadata within affinity groups.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Why:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Structured routing and key placement ensure that lookup efficiency is maintained even as the network grows.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fault Tolerance:</strong> DHTs handle churn (frequent node joins and leaves) with minimal disruption to search efficiency by updating routing tables and replicating keys.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reduced Overhead:</strong> Unlike unstructured systems that rely on query flooding (e.g., Gnutella), DHTs minimize network traffic by routing queries directly toward the target.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>13.6 How Does Chord Route Queries?</h4>

                <p><strong>What:</strong> Chord is a structured peer-to-peer system that routes queries efficiently using a virtual ring and finger tables, ensuring logarithmic lookup times (\(O(\log N)\)) for locating keys in a distributed network.</p>

                <p><strong>How:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Virtual Ring:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Nodes and keys are hashed into a circular identifier space (e.g., \(0\) to \(2^m - 1\)).</li>
                            <li>Each key is assigned to the first node whose ID is equal to or greater than the key's hash value (mod \(2^m\)).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Finger Tables:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Each node maintains a finger table with pointers to other nodes, calculated as \(n + 2^i\) (mod \(2^m\)), where \(i\) is the finger index.</li>
                            <li>The table allows each node to route queries closer to the target in logarithmic steps.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Query Routing:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>When a node receives a query for a key, it checks if it is responsible for the key (i.e., if the key lies between its ID and its successor's ID).</li>
                            <li>If not, the query is forwarded to the closest preceding node in the finger table (i.e., the node whose ID is closest to but less than the key).</li>
                            <li>This process repeats until the query reaches the node responsible for the key.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Why:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> The logarithmic structure of the finger table ensures that each query reduces the search space by half, achieving \(O(\log N)\) routing hops.</li>
                    <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> The system maintains efficiency even as the number of nodes increases.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fault Tolerance:</strong> Redundancy in successor lists ensures routing continues even if some nodes fail.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Consider a key \(k = 42\) and a query initiated by node \(n = 80\).</li>
                    <li>Node \(80\) forwards the query to the node closest to \(42\) in its finger table, say \(16\).</li>
                    <li>Node \(16\) forwards the query to \(32\), and finally, \(32\) forwards the query to \(45\), the node responsible for \(k = 42\).</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Key Characteristics:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Deterministic routing guarantees predictable query resolution.</li>
                    <li>Finger tables enable logarithmic scaling, making Chord efficient for large networks.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Chord routes queries by progressively narrowing down the search space using finger tables and successor lists, ensuring efficient and fault-tolerant key location in a distributed environment.</p>

                <h4>13.7 How Does Pastry Route Queries?</h4>

                <p><strong>What:</strong> Pastry is a structured peer-to-peer system that routes queries using prefix matching, achieving efficient routing in \(O(\log N)\) hops while incorporating network topology awareness to minimize latency.</p>

                <p><strong>How:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Node and Key Assignment:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Each node and key is assigned a unique identifier (ID) generated using a consistent hash function.</li>
                            <li>IDs are represented in a fixed-length base (e.g., base 4 or base 16), enabling prefix-based matching.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Routing Mechanism:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Nodes maintain a routing table organized by prefix levels. Each row corresponds to a prefix length, and each column points to a node whose ID matches that prefix.</li>
                            <li>Additionally, nodes maintain a leaf set of neighboring nodes sorted by numerical proximity and a neighborhood set to account for physical network proximity.</li>
                            <li>When a query is initiated for a key, the node examines its routing table to find the neighbor with the longest prefix match to the target key.</li>
                            <li>The query is forwarded to that neighbor, progressively reducing the prefix mismatch until it reaches the target node.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Network Topology Awareness:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>For each prefix, among potential matches, the neighbor with the shortest round-trip time is chosen, optimizing routing latency.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Why:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Prefix matching allows each routing step to narrow the search space exponentially, achieving \(O(\log N)\) hops.</li>
                    <li><strong>Topology Optimization:</strong> By considering network distances, Pastry minimizes latency, especially in geographically distributed networks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fault Tolerance:</strong> Redundancy through the leaf and neighborhood sets ensures that routing continues even if some nodes fail.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Suppose a query is initiated for key \(01110111001\) at node \(01110100101\):</li>
                    <li>The routing table directs the query to a neighbor with the longest matching prefix (e.g., \(011101*\)).</li>
                    <li>This process repeats, each step matching one additional digit of the prefix, until the query reaches the node responsible for the key.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Key Characteristics:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Efficient routing with \(O(\log N)\) hops.</li>
                    <li>Incorporates locality-awareness for reduced latency.</li>
                    <li>Fault-tolerant design with leaf and neighborhood sets for redundancy.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Pastry routes queries by progressively matching key prefixes in its routing table while optimizing for physical network proximity, ensuring efficient and low-latency key location in distributed systems.</p>

                <h4>13.8 How Does Kelips Route Queries?</h4>

                <p><strong>What:</strong> Kelips is a structured peer-to-peer system designed for constant-time (\(O(1)\)) lookups, achieved by replicating metadata across affinity groups.</p>

                <p><strong>How:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Affinity Groups:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The network is divided into \(k = \sqrt{N}\) affinity groups, where \(N\) is the total number of nodes.</li>
                            <li>Each node is hashed into one of these groups based on its ID.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Metadata Replication:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Each file’s name is hashed to determine its affinity group.</li>
                            <li>All nodes within the group replicate metadata for that file, such as its location (IP address and port of the host).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Neighbor Relationships:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Each node maintains knowledge of all other nodes within its own affinity group.</li>
                            <li>Additionally, each node stores a single contact for every other affinity group.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Query Routing:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>When a node searches for a file, it hashes the file name to identify its corresponding affinity group.</li>
                            <li>The query is routed to the node’s contact for that affinity group.</li>
                            <li>If the primary contact fails, the node retries with another contact from its neighbor list.</li>
                            <li>Once the query reaches any node in the group, the metadata is retrieved to locate the file’s host.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Why:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Kelips achieves constant lookup time (\(O(1)\)) because every node has direct access to metadata through its contacts or group members.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fault Tolerance:</strong> Replicating metadata across all nodes in an affinity group ensures availability even if multiple nodes fail.</li>
                    <li><strong>Low Latency:</strong> By storing metadata near the querying node, Kelips minimizes the time required for lookups.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Consider a file "PennyLane.mp3" that hashes to affinity group \(k-1\):</li>
                    <li>A node searching for "PennyLane.mp3" routes the query to its contact for group \(k-1\).</li>
                    <li>The contact retrieves the metadata for "PennyLane.mp3" and provides the host’s IP address and port.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Key Characteristics:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Lookup cost: \(O(1)\) in the best case.</li>
                    <li>Memory cost: \(O(\sqrt{N})\) per node for storing metadata and neighbor information.</li>
                    <li>Fault Tolerance: Multiple contacts and metadata replication ensure query success even during churn.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Kelips routes queries by hashing file names to affinity groups and directly accessing metadata through local or group-wide neighbors, achieving fast, fault-tolerant, and scalable lookups.</p>

                <h4>13.9 What is Churn in P2P Systems?</h4>

                <p><strong>What:</strong> Churn refers to the dynamic behavior of nodes in a peer-to-peer (P2P) network as they join, leave, or fail. It is a natural characteristic of P2P systems where nodes are often user-operated devices with varying availability.</p>

                <p><strong>How:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Node Behavior:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>New nodes join the network, increasing the total number of participants.</li>
                            <li>Existing nodes leave voluntarily, either temporarily or permanently.</li>
                            <li>Nodes fail unexpectedly due to hardware, software, or connectivity issues.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Impact on System:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Frequent changes in the network topology disrupt routing tables and data placement.</li>
                            <li>Replication strategies are used to ensure data availability despite node departures.</li>
                            <li>Maintenance protocols, such as stabilization in Chord or gossip-based membership in Kelips, are employed to adapt to churn.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Why:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Dynamic Nature of P2P Networks:</strong> Churn is inevitable in decentralized systems where nodes are controlled by individual users with inconsistent uptime.</li>
                    <li><strong>Resilience Testing:</strong> Understanding churn is critical for designing systems that remain stable and functional despite high turnover rates.</li>
                    <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Efficient handling of churn ensures that large-scale networks can continue operating without significant performance degradation.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Key Characteristics:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>High Churn Rates:</strong> Some systems like Gnutella experience churn rates as high as 100% per hour, meaning the entire set of participating nodes may change within an hour.</li>
                    <li><strong>Churn Effects:</strong> Frequent join/leave events require updates to routing tables, neighbor lists, and replicated data, leading to additional maintenance overhead.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fault Tolerance:</strong> Systems implement redundancy and recovery protocols to maintain functionality during churn.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Churn in P2P systems represents the continuous flux of nodes joining, leaving, or failing. Efficient management of churn is vital to ensure stability, fault tolerance, and scalability in distributed networks.</p>

                <h4>13.10 How Does Chord Maintain Correct Neighbors in Spite of Failures and Churn?</h4>

                <p><strong>What:</strong> Chord handles failures and churn (frequent joining and leaving of nodes) by maintaining and periodically updating neighbor information, ensuring efficient routing and data consistency in a dynamic network.</p>

                <p><strong>How:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Successor Lists:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Each node maintains a successor list, which includes multiple successors (e.g., \(r = \log(N)\)) instead of just one.</li>
                            <li>If the immediate successor fails, the node can use the next entry in the successor list to maintain connectivity.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Stabilization Protocol:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Nodes periodically run a stabilization protocol to ensure their successor pointers are correct.</li>
                            <li>During stabilization:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>A node contacts its successor to verify and update its own successor list.</li>
                                    <li>The successor also updates its predecessor pointer to point to the querying node, if necessary.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Finger Table Updates:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Nodes periodically refresh their finger tables by querying neighbors to discover more accurate entries.</li>
                            <li>The stabilization protocol indirectly helps populate correct finger table entries over time.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Replication of Keys:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>To prevent data loss, keys are replicated across the immediate successors in the successor list.</li>
                            <li>If a node fails, its keys are still accessible from its successors.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Failure Detection:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Chord uses periodic ping messages to detect node failures.</li>
                            <li>When a failure is detected, the affected node’s neighbors update their routing and replication information.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Why:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Fault Tolerance:</strong> Ensures that the system remains functional even if a significant portion of nodes fail or leave.</li>
                    <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Efficient neighbor maintenance minimizes overhead, allowing the system to scale to a large number of nodes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Availability:</strong> Replication and stabilization ensure that keys remain accessible despite churn.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Key Characteristics:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Stabilization runs periodically and incrementally updates neighbor information.</li>
                    <li>Successor lists provide redundancy to handle node failures seamlessly.</li>
                    <li>Replication ensures data persistence and load balancing.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Chord maintains correct neighbors through successor lists, stabilization protocols, finger table updates, and key replication, ensuring resilient and scalable operation even in dynamic P2P environments with high churn.</p>
