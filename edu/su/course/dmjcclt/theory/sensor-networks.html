                <h3>1. Introduction to Sensor Networks</h3>
                <h4>1.1 What are Sensor Networks?</h4>
                <p>A sensor network is a collection of interconnected devices, called sensor nodes, designed to sense, collect, and transmit data about their environment. These nodes operate collaboratively to provide a comprehensive view of a monitored area.</p>

                <h4>1.2 Why Sensor Networks?</h4>
                <p>The increasing demand for real-time, distributed, and automated monitoring systems has driven the adoption of sensor networks. Traditional monitoring methods often involve manual data collection, which can be inefficient, error-prone, and hazardous in remote or dangerous locations. Sensor networks solve these challenges by enabling:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Autonomous operation</strong>: Minimal human intervention is required.</li>
                    <li><strong>Scalability</strong>: Networks can cover vast or inaccessible regions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cost efficiency</strong>: Smaller, cheaper devices replace costly infrastructure.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>1.3 How Sensor Networks Work</h4>
                <p>Sensor networks rely on the interplay of sensing, computation, and communication to function effectively:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Sensing</strong>: Sensors measure specific parameters such as temperature, humidity, vibration, or motion and convert them into electrical signals.</li>
                    <li><strong>Computation</strong>: Microprocessors process raw sensor data into meaningful information, often performing tasks like filtering, aggregation, or compression.</li>
                    <li><strong>Communication</strong>: Processed data is transmitted wirelessly to a central station or cloud platform for further analysis or decision-making.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>1.4 Historical Context</h4>
                <h5>1.4.1 What are Early Sensors?</h5>
                <p>Early sensors were primitive tools designed to monitor specific environmental conditions, often relying on natural phenomena. For example, coal miners used canaries as early CO and CO<sub>2</sub> detectors. These birds, being sensitive to toxic gases, acted as a warning system—if the canary showed signs of distress, miners knew the environment was unsafe.</p>

                <h5>1.4.2 Why Were Sensors Needed?</h5>
                <p>The need for sensors arose from the requirement to ensure safety, efficiency, and predictive monitoring in challenging environments. Early methods lacked reliability, consistency, and precision, leading to risks such as undetected toxic gas leaks in mines or failures in mechanical systems during manufacturing.</p>

                <h5>1.4.3 How Have Sensors Evolved?</h5>
                <p>Advancements in materials, electronics, and computation have transformed sensors from basic tools to sophisticated devices capable of operating in extreme conditions. Modern sensor technology includes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Miniaturization</strong>: Sensors are now small enough to be deployed in environments like volcanoes or remote islands, where manual monitoring is impossible.</li>
                    <li><strong>Integration</strong>: Modern sensors often combine multiple sensing capabilities (e.g., temperature, pressure, and humidity) on a single chip.</li>
                    <li><strong>Autonomous Operation</strong>: Sensors now function independently, collecting and transmitting data without human intervention, making them suitable for hazardous or inaccessible locations.</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>1.4.4 Significance of Historical Evolution</h5>
                <p>This progression has broadened the scope of applications for sensors, enabling use cases ranging from industrial automation to environmental conservation. The move from biological indicators (like canaries) to electronic and mechanical sensors represents a critical leap in technological innovation, facilitating the emergence of sensor networks as we know them today.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Range:</strong> RF covers greater distances, while optical is typically limited to shorter, line-of-sight communication.</li>
                    <li><strong>Power Efficiency:</strong> Optical transmission is more energy-efficient than RF for short-range communication.</li>
                    <li><strong>Deployment Flexibility:</strong> RF is more versatile due to its ability to work in non-line-of-sight conditions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Interference:</strong> RF is prone to interference from other electromagnetic sources, while optical is less susceptible but sensitive to physical obstructions.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>3.4 Communication Considerations</h4>
                <p>The choice between RF and optical transmission depends on the application's requirements, such as range, energy constraints, and environmental conditions. Networks often combine these technologies to leverage their respective strengths for optimal communication efficiency.</p>
