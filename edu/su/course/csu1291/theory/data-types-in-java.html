                <h3>1. Introduction to Java Data Types</h3>
                <p>At the heart of every programming language lies the concept of data types. In Java, data types play a fundamental role, allowing programmers to define the nature and operations of the data they're working with. Java offers a rich set of data types, and understanding them is essential to writing efficient and error-free code.</p>
            </article>

            <article id="classification">
                <h4>1.1 Classification of Java Data Types</h4>
                <p>In the realm of Java, data types are essential constructs that determine the type of data a variable can store. Java offers a varied spectrum of data types, each tailored for specific needs. These data types are broadly bifurcated into two categories: Primitive and Reference data types.</p>

                <h5>1.1.1 Primitive Data Types</h5>
                <p>Primitive data types are the foundational data types of Java. They are directly embedded into the Java language and offer a raw, efficient way to represent simple data. Here are some distinctive characteristics of primitive data types:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Since they are built into the language, their storage and access are highly optimized, ensuring rapid execution.</li>
                    <li><strong>Immutable:</strong> Their values cannot be altered once defined, making them predictable and reliable.</li>
                    <li><strong>Stack Storage:</strong> They are stored in the stack memory, which facilitates faster access but has a limited lifespan (they exist only within the scope of their containing method).</li>
                    <li><strong>Fixed Size:</strong> Each primitive data type has a predefined size, ensuring consistent memory usage.</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>1.1.2 Reference Data Types</h5>
                <p>Contrasting with the simplicity of primitive data types, reference data types introduce a layer of complexity, but with greater flexibility. They represent references to memory locations, rather than containing the actual data. Key aspects of reference data types include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Dynamic:</strong> Instead of being defined in the language, they are created using Java's object-oriented features, making them dynamic and extensible.</li>
                    <li><strong>Heap Storage:</strong> They are stored in the heap memory, which allows for longer-lived, but slightly slower, data access compared to stack storage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Size Variability:</strong> Unlike primitives, the size of reference data types can vary based on the object or array they reference.</li>
                    <li><strong>Default Value:</strong> If not explicitly initialized, reference variables are given a default value of <code>null</code>, indicating that they don't reference any memory location yet.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Within the category of reference data types, there are two primary types to be familiar with:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Objects:</strong> Instances of user-defined or built-in classes. Each object can encapsulate both data (attributes) and operations (methods).</li>
                    <li><strong>Arrays:</strong> Homogeneous data structures capable of storing multiple values of the same type. Arrays offer indexed access to their elements.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>While primitive data types offer efficiency and simplicity, reference data types provide the dynamism and flexibility needed for more complex programming tasks. Grasping the nuances of these types is pivotal for effective Java programming.</p>

                <h4>1.2 Primitive Data Types</h4>
                <p>Primitive data types are the building blocks of Java programming. They are predefined by the language and provide the raw materials for constructing complex data structures:</p>

            </article>
            <article>
                <h5>1.2.1 <code>byte</code></h5>
                <p>An 8-bit signed two's complement integer. It has a minimum value of -128 and a maximum value of 127 (inclusive).</p>
                <pre><code class="language-java">byte b = 10;</code></pre>

                <ul class="list-unstyled">
                    <li><strong>The 'byte' Data Type:</strong>
                        <p>Within the gamut of primitive data types in Java, the <code>byte</code> holds a unique position due to its compact size. It's a testament to Java's commitment to efficiency and optimization.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Overview:</strong>
                        <p>The <code>byte</code> data type is an 8-bit signed two's complement integer. Being 8-bit means it consists of 8 binary digits (i.e., 0s and 1s). The "two's complement" notation is a mathematical representation that allows both positive and negative numbers.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Range</strong>
                        <p>The range of the <code>byte</code> data type extends from -128 to 127. This range is derived from its 8-bit size. The most significant bit (the leftmost bit) is reserved for sign representation, leaving 7 bits for the numeric value, which yields \(2^7\) or 128 possible values. Half of these are negative, and the other half are non-negative, giving us the range mentioned.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Usage</strong>
                        <p>The <code>byte</code> data type is particularly useful when you're working with raw binary data or when memory usage is a concern. Its small size ensures minimal memory consumption, making it ideal for arrays or streams of data where the individual elements fall within its range.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Example</strong>
                        <pre><code class="language-java">byte b = 10;</code></pre>
                        <p>This code snippet demonstrates the declaration and initialization of a <code>byte</code> variable named <code>b</code> with the value 10.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Caveats</strong>
                        <p>While the <code>byte</code> data type is efficient, care should be taken when using it in arithmetic operations. Operations that result in values outside its range will lead to overflow or underflow, potentially causing unexpected results.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h5>1.2.2 <code>short</code></h5>
                <p>A 16-bit signed two's complement integer. It has a minimum value of -32,768 and a maximum value of 32,767 (inclusive).</p>
                <pre><code class="language-java">short s = 500;</code></pre>

                <ul class="list-unstyled">
                    <li><strong>The 'short' Data Type:</strong>
                        <p>The <code>short</code> data type in Java, while larger than a <code>byte</code>, remains an efficient choice for storing numerical data that doesn't quite need the capacity of an <code>int</code>. It's a balance between memory conservation and numerical range.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Overview:</strong>
                        <p>The <code>short</code> data type is a 16-bit signed two's complement integer. This means it can represent numbers with 16 binary digits (0s and 1s), where one bit is reserved for indicating the sign of the number (positive or negative).</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Range:</strong>
                        <p>The range for the <code>short</code> data type spans from -32,768 to 32,767. This range is derived from its 16-bit size, with one bit reserved for the sign, allowing \(2^{15}\) or 32,768 possible values for both the negative and non-negative sides.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Usage:</strong>
                        <p><code>short</code> is ideal for scenarios where memory optimization is crucial, yet the data might exceed the capacity of a <code>byte</code>. Examples include certain mathematical operations, arrays with larger datasets, or when interacting with specific libraries or external data sources.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Example:</strong>
                        <pre><code class="language-java">short s = 500;</code></pre>
                        <p>This code represents the declaration and initialization of a <code>short</code> variable named <code>s</code>, assigned the value 500.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Caveats:</strong>
                        <p>While the <code>short</code> data type offers a larger range than <code>byte</code>, it's still susceptible to overflow and underflow. Ensure that arithmetic operations don't result in values outside its permissible range.</p>

                <h5>1.2.3 <code>int</code></h5>
                <p>A 32-bit signed two's complement integer. Its range is from \(-2^{31}\) to \(2^{31} - 1\).</p>
                <pre><code class="language-java">int i = 1000;</code></pre>

                <ul class="list-unstyled">
                    <li><strong>The 'int' Data Type:</strong>
                        <p>The <code>int</code> data type is arguably the most commonly used numerical data type in Java. Its considerable size makes it suitable for a wide range of applications, from simple arithmetic to complex algorithms.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Overview:</strong>
                        <p>The <code>int</code> data type is a 32-bit signed two's complement integer. With 32 binary digits at its disposal, and one bit reserved for the sign, it offers a broad range of positive and negative values.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Range:</strong>
                        <p>The range for the <code>int</code> data type spans from \(-2^{31}\) to \(2^{31} - 1\). This range ensures that the data type can handle reasonably large numbers, accommodating a wide array of computational needs.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Usage:</strong>
                        <p>The versatility of the <code>int</code> data type makes it a default choice for many programming scenarios. Whether you're counting loop iterations, calculating dimensions, or managing data in arrays, <code>int</code> often fits the bill.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Example:</strong>
                        <pre><code class="language-java">int i = 1000;</code></pre>
                        <p>This example shows the declaration and initialization of an <code>int</code> variable named <code>i</code> with the value 1000.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Caveats:</strong>
                        <p>Despite its broad range, the <code>int</code> data type can still experience overflow and underflow. While these occurrences might be rarer than with smaller data types, it's crucial to be aware of them, especially during extensive arithmetic operations or when handling large datasets.</p>

                <p>A 64-bit signed two's complement integer. Its range is from \(-2^{63}\) to \(2^{63} - 1\).</p>
                <pre><code class="language-java">long l = 5000L;</code></pre>

                <ul class="list-unstyled">
                    <li><strong>The 'long' Data Type:</strong>
                        <p>When numbers exceed the capacity of the <code>int</code> data type or when very large datasets are involved, Java's <code>long</code> data type comes into play. It's designed to handle vast numerical values, making it suitable for high-precision computations.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Overview:</strong>
                        <p>The <code>long</code> data type is a 64-bit signed two's complement integer. With double the bits of an <code>int</code>, it provides a significantly expanded range.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Range:</strong>
                        <p>The range for the <code>long</code> data type extends from \(-2^{63}\) to \(2^{63} - 1\), making it capable of representing extremely large positive and negative numbers.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Usage:</strong>
                        <p>The <code>long</code> data type is apt for scenarios requiring large numbers, such as scientific calculations, financial applications with high precision, or systems that handle large datasets.</p>

                <h4>1.3 Reference Data Types</h4>
                <p>Reference data types refer to objects and arrays. They are created using constructors of the classes.</p>
                <p>While primitive data types are the bedrock of Java's data representation, reference data types elevate the language's capability, allowing it to model real-world scenarios more effectively. Instead of representing simple values, reference data types refer to memory locations where data is stored. This category encompasses objects and arrays, foundational to Java's object-oriented paradigm. Let's explore them:</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h5>1.3.1 Objects</h5>
                <p>Objects are foundational to Java, being at the core of its object-oriented paradigm. They encapsulate data and the operations that can be performed on that data.</p>

                <ul class="list-unstyled">
                    <li><strong>Introduction to Objects:</strong>
                        <p>In Java, everything is associated with objects and classes. An object is essentially a self-contained unit that consists of state (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that operate on the state. It's like a blueprint that defines the characteristics and behaviors of its instances.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Attributes and Behaviors:</strong>
                        <p>An object's attributes are the data members or variables that store its state. The behaviors, on the other hand, are represented by methods that act on this data and may return a result. Together, attributes and methods allow objects to represent real-world entities in a programming context.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Instantiation:</strong>
                        <p>Creating an object from a class is called instantiation. When an object is instantiated, a space in memory is allocated to it. This object then can be used to access the attributes and methods defined by its class.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Example:</strong>
                        <pre><code class="language-java">String str = "Hello";</code></pre>
                        <p>This example showcases the creation of an object <code>str</code> of the class <code>String</code>. The object <code>str</code> is instantiated with the value "Hello".</p>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Caveats:</strong>
                        <p>Objects in Java, being part of the dynamic memory (heap), need to be managed properly. While Java has a garbage collector that automatically deletes unused objects to free up memory, it's still a good practice to set objects to <code>null</code> if they're no longer needed, making it easier for the garbage collector to reclaim that memory.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h5>1.3.2 Arrays</h5>
                <p>Arrays are fundamental structures in Java, allowing for the organized storage of multiple elements under a single variable name. These elements, while stored contiguously in memory, can be efficiently accessed and manipulated using indices.</p>

                <ul class="list-unstyled">
                    <li><strong>Introduction to Arrays:</strong>
                        <p>An array is a collection of elements, all of the same type, packed into a single unit. This collection provides a way to store and organize a series of items sequentially, which can be accessed by their respective indices.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Characteristics of Arrays:</strong>
                        <p>Arrays have a fixed size, determined at the time of their creation. Due to this static nature, the size of an array cannot be changed once it's defined. Each element in the array is identified by an array index, which starts from 0 for the first element and goes up to one less than the size of the array for the last element.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Memory Allocation:</strong>
                        <p>Arrays in Java are objects, and they are allocated on the heap. This contiguous block of memory ensures that accessing elements using indices is a fast operation.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Example:</strong>
                        <pre><code class="language-java">int[] arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};</code></pre>
                        <p>In this example, an array of integers named <code>arr</code> is declared and initialized. It consists of five elements, and each can be accessed using its index, e.g., <code>arr[0]</code> would return the value 1.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Caveats:</strong>
                        <p>While arrays offer a straightforward way to store multiple elements, their fixed size can be a limitation. For dynamic storage needs, Java provides various collection classes like <code>ArrayList</code> which can grow or shrink in size dynamically. Moreover, out-of-bound array accesses (using an index beyond the array's size) will throw a runtime exception in Java, specifically <code>ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException</code>.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h4>1.4 Taking Input in Java</h4>
                <p>Java provides several mechanisms to obtain input from the user. One of the most commonly used methods, especially for beginners, is the <code>Scanner</code> class from the <code>java.util</code> package. This class offers methods to parse primitive types and strings using regular expressions, making it versatile for various input requirements.</p>

                <ul class="list-unstyled">
                    <li><strong>Initialization:</strong>
                        <p>The first step to using the <code>Scanner</code> class is to create an instance of it. The <code>System.in</code> parameter passed to its constructor tells the scanner to take input from the standard input stream, which is usually the keyboard.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Reading Different Data Types:</strong>
                        <p>The <code>Scanner</code> class provides various methods to read different data types, such as <code>nextInt()</code>, <code>nextDouble()</code>, <code>nextLine()</code>, and so on. This allows for flexible input processing based on the expected data.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Closing the Scanner:</strong>
                        <p>It's a good practice to close the scanner once it's no longer in use. This releases the resources associated with it and avoids potential memory leaks or resource conflicts.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Example:</strong>
                        <pre><code class="language-java">import java.util.Scanner;

public class InputDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.println("Enter a byte value:");
        byte b = scanner.nextByte();

        System.out.println("Enter a short value:");
        short s = scanner.nextShort();

        System.out.println("Enter an integer:");
        int i = scanner.nextInt();

        System.out.println("Enter a long value:");
        long l = scanner.nextLong();

        System.out.println("Enter a float value:");
        float f = scanner.nextFloat();

        System.out.println("Enter a double value:");
        double d = scanner.nextDouble();

        System.out.println("Enter a character:");
        char c = scanner.next().charAt(0);  // Reads the first character of the input string

        System.out.println("Enter a boolean value (true/false):");
        boolean flag = scanner.nextBoolean();

        System.out.println("Enter a string:");
        scanner.nextLine();  // Consume leftover newline
        String str = scanner.nextLine();  // Reads a full line

        System.out.println("Enter the number of elements in the array:");
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        int[] arr = new int[n];
        System.out.println("Enter " + n + " integer values for the array:");
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            arr[j] = scanner.nextInt();
        }

        // Close the scanner to prevent resource leaks.
        scanner.close();

        // Outputs (for verification purposes)
        System.out.println("Byte: " + b);
        System.out.println("Short: " + s);
        System.out.println("Integer: " + i);
        System.out.println("Long: " + l);
        System.out.println("Float: " + f);
        System.out.println("Double: " + d);
        System.out.println("Char: " + c);
        System.out.println("Boolean: " + flag);
        System.out.println("String: " + str);
        System.out.print("Array: ");
        for (int value : arr) {
            System.out.print(value + " ");
        }
    }
}</code></pre>
                        <p>This code segment exemplifies the usage of the <code>Scanner</code> class to obtain various data types as input from the user. It's a foundational skill for anyone venturing into Java programming.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Caveats:</strong>
                        <p>While the <code>Scanner</code> class is intuitive for beginners, it's essential to be cautious about input mismatches. For instance, using <code>nextInt()</code> when the user provides a non-integer value will result in an <code>InputMismatchException</code>. It's advisable to include error-handling mechanisms, like try-catch blocks, to gracefully manage such scenarios.</p>
