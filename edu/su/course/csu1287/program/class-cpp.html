                <h3>What is a Class in C++ and Its Other Methods</h3>
                <p>In C++, a class is a user-defined data type that encapsulates data and functions into a single unit. It defines a blueprint for creating objects that have the same attributes and behavior. A class is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming, which emphasizes the use of objects and their interactions to model real-world problems.</p>
                <p>
                    The idea behind a class is to group related data and functions together in a way that makes the code easier to understand, maintain, and reuse. By defining a class, you can create a new data type that has its own set of attributes (called data members) and behaviors (called member functions). These data members and member functions can be accessed only through an instance of the class, which is created using the new operator.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A class is declared using the class keyword, followed by the class name, which should be capitalized by convention. The data members of the class are declared inside the class definition, and their access is controlled by the access specifiers, which can be public, private, or protected. Public members can be accessed from anywhere, private members can be accessed only from within the class, and protected members can be accessed from within the class and its derived classes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The member functions of the class are also declared inside the class definition, and they can operate on the data members of the class. Member functions are used to define the behavior of the objects created from the class, and they can be called using the dot operator on an instance of the class. For example, if we have a class called Rectangle with a member function called <code>getArea()</code>, we can create an instance of the Rectangle class and call the <code>getArea()</code> function on that instance using the dot operator:</p>
                <pre><code class="language-cpp">Rectangle rectangle(5, 10);
int area = rectangle.getArea();</code></pre>
                <p>
                    Constructors and destructors are special member functions that are used to create and destroy instances of the class, respectively. Constructors are called when an object is created, and they initialize the object's data members to their default values. Destructors are called when an object is destroyed, and they free up any resources that the object was using, such as memory allocated with the new operator.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to data members and member functions, a class can also have overloaded operators, which are used to define the behavior of operators, such as +, -, *, /, and =, when they are used with objects created from the class. Overloaded operators can make the code more readable and intuitive, and they can simplify common tasks, such as comparing or adding objects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, a class can also have friend functions, which are non-member functions that have access to the private and protected members of the class. Friend functions are declared in the class using the friend keyword, and they can be useful in situations where you need to access the private or protected members of a class from outside the class.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Overall, a class in C++ is a powerful mechanism for creating complex data structures and defining their behavior. By encapsulating data and functions into a single unit, classes can make the code more modular, maintainable, and reusable. They are a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming, and they provide a way to model real-world problems using the concepts of objects and their interactions.
                </p>

                <p>A class can contain the following methods:</p>
