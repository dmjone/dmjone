        <h4>Introduction</h4>
        <p>In C++, the scope resolution operator (<code>::</code>) is used to access a variable, function or class member that is defined in a different scope. This operator is used to resolve name conflicts between global and local variables or between variables defined in different classes. In this article, we will discuss in detail about the scope resolution operator in C++ and its various uses.</p>

        <h4>Understanding Scope in C++</h4>
        <p>Scope refers to the region of a program where a particular variable or function is visible and can be accessed. In C++, there are three types of scopes, namely:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Global Scope</strong>: Variables and functions declared outside of any function or class have global scope. They can be accessed from any part of the program.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Function Scope</strong>: Variables declared inside a function have function scope. They can only be accessed within the function where they are declared.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Class Scope</strong>: Variables and functions declared inside a class have class scope. They can be accessed using an object of the class or by using the scope resolution operator.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h4>The Scope Resolution Operator (<code>::</code>)</h4>
        <p>The scope resolution operator is denoted by two colons (::) and is used to access a variable or function that is defined in a different scope. The syntax for using the scope resolution operator is as follows:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-cpp"><scope>::<name></code></pre>
        <p>Here, the <scope> can be the name of a class, a namespace or the global scope. The <name> is the name of the variable or function that we want to access.</p>

        <h4>Using the Scope Resolution Operator with Namespaces</h4>
        <p>
          In C++, namespaces are used to organize code into logical groups and avoid naming conflicts. The scope resolution operator can be used to access a variable or function that is defined in a namespace. The syntax for using the scope resolution operator with namespaces is as follows:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-cpp"><namespace>::<name></code></pre>
        <p>Here, the <namespace> is the name of the namespace and <name> is the name of the variable or function that we want to access. For example, let's say we have a namespace called "myNamespace" and it contains a variable called "myVar". We can access this variable using the scope resolution operator as follows:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-cpp">myNamespace::myVar</code></pre>
      </article>

        <h4>Using the Scope Resolution Operator with Classes</h4>
        <p>In C++, classes are used to define objects that have properties and methods. The scope resolution operator can be used to access a variable or function that is defined in a class. The syntax for using the scope resolution operator with classes is as follows:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-cpp"><className>::<name></code></pre>
        <p>Here, the <className> is the name of the class and <name> is the name of the variable or function that we want to access. For example, let's say we have a class called "myClass" and it contains a variable called "myVar". We can access this variable using the scope resolution operator as follows:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-cpp">myClass::myVar</code></pre>
      </article>

        <h4>Using the Scope Resolution Operator with Nested Classes</h4>
        <p>In C++, it is possible to define a class inside another class. These are called nested classes. The scope resolution operator can be used to access a variable or function that is defined in a nested class. The syntax for using the scope resolution operator with nested classes is as follows:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-cpp"><outerClassName>::<innerClassName>::<name></code></pre>
        <p>Here, the <outerClassName> is the name of the outer class, <innerClassName> is the name of the nested class and <name> is the name of the variable or function that we want to access. For example, let's say we have a class called "outerClass" and it contains a nested class called "innerClass". The inner class contains a variable called "myVar". We can access this variable using the scope resolution operator as follows:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-cpp">outerClass::innerClass::myVar</code></pre>
      </article>

        <h4>Using the Scope Resolution Operator with Static Members</h4>
        <p>
          In C++, static members are variables or functions that are associated with the class itself rather than with any particular instance of the class. The scope resolution operator can be used to access a static member that is defined in a class. The syntax for using the scope resolution operator with static members is as follows:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-cpp"><className>::<staticMemberName></code></pre>
        <p>Here, the <className> is the name of the class and <staticMemberName> is the name of the static member that we want to access. For example, let's say we have a class called "myClass" and it contains a static member variable called "myStaticVar". We can access this variable using the scope resolution operator as follows:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-cpp">myClass::myStaticVar</code></pre>
      </article>

        <h4>Using the Scope Resolution Operator with Inheritance</h4>
        <p>In C++, inheritance is used to create a new class that is a modified version of an existing class. The derived class inherits all the members of the base class and can also define its own members. The scope resolution operator can be used to access a member that is inherited from a base class. The syntax for using the scope resolution operator with inheritance is as follows:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-cpp"><baseClassName>::<name></code></pre>
        <p>Here, the <baseClassName> is the name of the base class and <name> is the name of the member that we want to access. For example, let's say we have a base class called "baseClass" and a derived class called "derivedClass". The base class contains a variable called "myVar". We can access this variable in the derived class using the scope resolution operator as follows:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-cpp">baseClass::myVar</code></pre>

        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
        <p>The scope resolution operator is an important feature in C++ that allows us to access a variable, function or class member that is defined in a different scope. It is commonly used to resolve name conflicts between global and local variables or between variables defined in different classes. In this article, we have discussed the different uses of the scope resolution operator in C++ with examples. Understanding the scope resolution operator is essential for writing efficient and error-free C++ programs.</p>
