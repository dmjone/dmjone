        <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
        <p>Aggregation, also known as composition, is an object-oriented programming concept that allows the creation of complex objects by combining simpler ones. In C++, aggregation is a way to design classes with other classes as their members. This article will cover various aspects of aggregation and inheritance in C++, from the basic concepts to advanced topics for computer science students. The article will explore derived class constructors, member functions, inheritance in the English distance class, class hierarchies, inheritance and graphics shapes, public and private inheritance, aggregation, and inheritance in program development.</p>

        <h3>2. Derived Class Constructors</h3>
        <p>Derived class constructors are special member functions used to create objects of a derived class. When a derived class object is created, the base class constructor is called first, followed by the derived class constructor. This ensures that both base and derived class members are properly initialized.</p>
        <h4>2.1 Invoking Base Class Constructors</h4>
        <p>When initializing a derived class object, it is essential to ensure that the base class constructor is called first. This can be done using the member initializer list in the derived class constructor. Here's an example:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-cpp">// Base class
class Base {
public:
    Base(int x) : m_x(x) {}
private:
  int m_x;
};

// Derived class
class Derived : public Base {
public:
  Derived(int x, int y) : Base(x), m_y(y) {}

private:
  int m_y;
};</code></pre>

        <p>In this example, the derived class constructor <code>Derived(int x, int y)</code> explicitly calls the base class constructor <code>Base(int x)</code> using the member initializer list. This ensures that the base class member <code>m_x</code> is initialized before the derived class member <code>m_y</code>.</p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h3>3. Member Functions</h3>
        <p>Member functions are functions that are part of a class and can be called using objects of that class. They have access to the class's data members and can modify them as needed. In the context of inheritance, member functions can be inherited, overridden, or hidden depending on the access specifier and function signature.</p>
        <h4>3.1 Inherited Member Functions</h4>
        <p>When a class is derived from another class, the derived class inherits the base class's member functions. These inherited member functions can be called using objects of the derived class, unless the base class's access specifier is <code>private</code>.</p>
        <h4>3.2 Overriding Member Functions</h4>
        <p>In a derived class, a member function can be overridden by providing a new implementation with the same name and signature. This new implementation will be called when the function is invoked using an object of the derived class. To ensure that the function is correctly overridden, the <code>override</code> keyword can be used. This tells the compiler to generate an error if the function is not actually overriding a base class function.</p>
        <h4>3.3 Hiding Member Functions</h4>
        <p>If a derived class has a member function with the same name as a base class function but a different signature, the derived class function will hide the base class function. This means that the base class function cannot be called using objects of the derived class.</p>

        <h3>4. Inheritance in the English Distance Class</h3>

        <p>Inheritance is a key concept in object-oriented programming that allows a new class to be created based on an existing one, inheriting its data members and member functions. The English distance class is an example that demonstrates inheritance in C++.</p>
        <h4>4.1 Base Class: Distance</h4>
        <p>The base class, <code>Distance</code>, represents a distance in feet and inches. It has two data members, <code>m_feet</code> and <code>m_inches</code>, and provides member functions for setting and displaying the distance:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-cpp">class Distance {
public:
    Distance(int feet, int inches) : m_feet(feet), m_inches(inches) {}
    void setDistance(int feet, int inches) {
        m_feet = feet;
        m_inches = inches;
    }
    void displayDistance() const {
        std::cout << m_feet << "' " << m_inches << "\"" << std::endl;
    }
private:
  int m_feet;
  int m_inches;
};</code></pre>

        <h4>4.2 Derived Class: DistanceMetric</h4>
        <p>The derived class, <code>DistanceMetric</code>, extends the <code>Distance</code> class and provides additional functionality for converting the distance to metric units:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-cpp">class DistanceMetric : public Distance {
public:
    DistanceMetric(int feet, int inches) : Distance(feet, inches) {}
    double toMeters() const {
        return (m_feet * 0.3048) + (m_inches * 0.0254);
    }
};</code></pre>
        <p>Here, the <code>DistanceMetric</code> class inherits the data members and member functions of the <code>Distance</code> class, and adds a new member function <code>toMeters()</code> to convert the distance to meters.</p>
      </article>

        <h3>5. Class Hierarchies</h3>
        <p>Class hierarchies are a way of organizing classes in a tree-like structure, with a base class at the top and derived classes below it. Each derived class can further have its own derived classes, creating a hierarchical structure. This organization allows for code reuse and modularity in large-scale projects.</p>
        <h4>5.1 Single Inheritance</h4>
        <p>In single inheritance, a derived class inherits from a single base class. This creates a simple, linear class hierarchy.</p>
        <h4>5.2 Multiple Inheritance</h4>
        <p>Multiple inheritance allows a derived class to inherit from more than one base class. This can lead to more complex class hierarchies and potential issues such as the diamond problem, where a class ends up with multiple copies of a base class's members due to ambiguous inheritance paths.</p>

        <h3>6. Inheritance and Graphics Shapes</h3>
        <p>Inheritance is a powerful concept in the design of graphical applications, as it allows for the creation of a hierarchy of shape classes. A base class can be used to represent a generic shape, and derived classes can extend this to represent specific shapes such as circles, rectangles, and triangles.</p>
        <h4>6.1 Base Class: Shape</h4>
        <p>The base class, <code>Shape</code>, provides a common interface for all shapes, including member functions for drawing, moving, and resizing the shape:</p>

        <pre><code class="language-cpp">class Shape {
public:
    virtual void draw() const = 0;
    virtual void move(int dx, int dy) = 0;
    virtual void resize(double factor) = 0;
};</code></pre>
        <p>In this example, the <code>Shape</code> class has three pure virtual member functions, making it an abstract class. This means that objects of the <code>Shape</code> class cannot be instantiated directly, and the class must be inherited by a derived class that provides implementations for the pure virtual functions.</p>
        <h4>6.2 Derived Classes: Circle, Rectangle, Triangle</h4>
        <p>Derived classes representing specific shapes can inherit from the base <code>Shape</code> class and provide implementations for the pure virtual functions:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-cpp">class Circle : public Shape {
public:
    // Circle-specific member functions and data members
    void draw() const override;
    void move(int dx, int dy) override;
    void resize(double factor) override;
};
class Rectangle : public Shape {
public:
  // Rectangle-specific member functions and data members
  void draw() const override;
  void move(int dx, int dy) override;
  void resize(double factor) override;
};

class Triangle : public Shape {
public:
  // Triangle-specific member functions and data members
  void draw() const override;
  void move(int dx, int dy) override;
  void resize(double factor) override;
};</code></pre>

        <p>With this hierarchy of shape classes, new shape types can be easily added by deriving from the <code>Shape</code> class and providing the necessary implementations for the pure virtual functions.</p>

        <h3>7. Public and Private Inheritance</h3>
        <p>Inheritance can be specified with different access specifiers, such as <code>public</code>, <code>protected</code>, or <code>private</code>. These specifiers determine the accessibility of the base class members in the derived class and the level of encapsulation.</p>
        <h4>7.1 Public Inheritance</h4>
        <p>Public inheritance is the most common form of inheritance in C++. With public inheritance, the public members of the base class become public members of the derived class, and the protected members of the base class become protected members of the derived class. The private members of the base class are not accessible in the derived class.</p>
        <h4>7.2 Private Inheritance</h4>
        <p>Private inheritance is a form of inheritance where the public and protected members of the base class become private members of the derived class. This means that these members are not accessible outside of the derived class. Private inheritance is often used when a derived class needs to use the base class's implementation but does not want to expose its interface.</p>

        <h3>8. Aggregation: Classes within Classes</h3>
        <p>Aggregation, or composition, is a design technique that allows a class to have objects of other classes as its members. This creates a "has-a" relationship between the containing class and the contained classes, where the containing class is composed of the contained classes.</p>
        <h4>8.1 Example: Car and Engine Classes</h4>
        <p>Consider a <code>Car</code> class that has an <code>Engine</code> class object as a data member:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-cpp">class Engine {
public:
  // Engine-specific member functions and data members
};

class Car {
public:
  // Car-specific member functions and data members

private:
  Engine m_engine; // Car "has-a" Engine
};</code></pre>

        <p>In this example, the <code>Car</code> class contains an object of the <code>Engine</code> class as a data member, creating an aggregation relationship between the two classes. This relationship allows the <code>Car</code> class to use the functionality provided by the <code>Engine</code> class while maintaining a clean separation between their respective implementations.</p>
        <h4>8.2 Benefits of Aggregation</h4>
        <p>Aggregation provides several benefits in the design and development of software systems:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Modularity:</strong> Aggregation promotes modularity by allowing the functionality of a class to be split into smaller, more focused classes that can be easily maintained and extended.</li>
          <li><strong>Reusability:</strong> Aggregated classes can be reused in other contexts, reducing code duplication and improving the overall maintainability of the system.</li>
          <li><strong>Encapsulation:</strong> Aggregation allows a class to hide the details of its internal implementation, exposing only a minimal interface to its clients. This improves the robustness of the system and simplifies the task of making changes to the implementation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>9. Inheritance and Program Development</h3>
        <p>Inheritance plays a crucial role in the design and development of large-scale software systems. It promotes code reuse, modularity, and maintainability, making it easier to develop complex applications. Some of the key benefits of using inheritance in program development include:</p>
        <h4>9.1 Code Reuse</h4>
        <p>Inheritance allows a derived class to reuse the data members and member functions of its base class, reducing code duplication and simplifying the development process. This can lead to more efficient and maintainable code.</p>
        <h4>9.2 Polymorphism</h4>
        <p>Polymorphism is a powerful feature in object-oriented programming that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. This enables the creation of more flexible and extensible software systems. Inheritance is the foundation for implementing polymorphism in C++ through the use of virtual functions and abstract base classes.</p>
        <h4>9.3 Extensibility</h4>
        <p>Inheritance makes it easy to extend an existing class hierarchy with new classes, allowing for the addition of new functionality without modifying the existing code. This promotes a modular design, making the software more adaptable to changing requirements and easier to maintain.</p>
