                <h3>Basic Concepts of Operating Systems</h3>
                <p>Operating Systems (OS) serve as the foundational software that manages computer hardware and software resources, offering common services for computer programs. This documentation aims to explain the intricate details of operating systems, focusing on their critical components, functionality, and the role they play in computer operation.</p>


                <article id="post">
                    <h4>POST (Power-On Self Test)</h4>
                    <p>The Power-On Self Test is the initial set of diagnostic tests performed by the computer's firmware, typically the BIOS (Basic Input/Output System), immediately after the computer is powered on. The purpose of POST is to ensure that the computer's hardware components are functioning correctly before loading the operating system. If the tests detect a failure in a critical component, the computer will not proceed to load the OS, and an error message will be displayed or beep codes will be emitted to indicate the problem.</p>

                <article id="main-memory">
                    <h4>Main Memory</h4>
                    <p>Main Memory, also known as RAM (Random Access Memory), is the primary storage area that the CPU (Central Processing Unit) uses to store data and programs while they are being executed. RAM is volatile, meaning it loses its contents when the power is turned off. It plays a crucial role in determining the speed and performance of a computer, as it directly affects how quickly the CPU can access instructions and data needed for processing tasks.</p>

                <article id="secondary-storage">
                    <h4>Secondary Storage</h4>
                    <p>Secondary Storage refers to non-volatile storage devices like HDDs (Hard Disk Drives), SSDs (Solid State Drives), and USB flash drives. Unlike main memory, secondary storage retains data even when the computer is turned off. It is used to permanently store data and programs that are not currently in use. The transfer of programs and data from secondary storage to main memory is a critical operation for program execution and data processing.</p>

                <article id="virtual-memory">
                    <h4>Virtual Memory</h4>
                    <p>Virtual Memory is a memory management capability of an OS that uses hardware and software to allow a computer to compensate for physical memory shortages, by temporarily transferring data from random access memory (RAM) to disk storage. This process creates an illusion for users of a very large (virtual) memory space. Virtual memory allows for the execution of programs that may not completely fit in the main memory, by swapping pieces of data or program code in and out of the main memory as needed.</p>

                <article id="transfer-control-bios-os">
                    <h4>Transfer of Control from the Motherboard's BIOS to the Operating System (OS)</h4>
                    <p>After the POST process concludes successfully, the control of the computer is transferred from the motherboard's BIOS to the Operating System. This transition is facilitated through the reading of the OS stored on the secondary storage device into the main memory. The BIOS identifies the bootable device, reads the boot sector, and executes the bootloader, which then loads the OS into memory, initiating the startup or boot process.</p>

                <article id="programs-secondary-memory">
                    <h4>Programs in Secondary Memory and Their Transfer to Main Memory</h4>
                    <p>Programs and data are stored in secondary memory due to its non-volatile nature. When a program is executed, the operating system transfers the program's executable code from secondary memory to main memory. This transfer is necessary because the CPU can only execute instructions that are in main memory. The efficient management of this transfer process is crucial for system performance and responsiveness.</p>

                <article id="multitasking">
                    <h4>Multitasking</h4>
                    <p>Multitasking is the capability of an operating system to execute multiple processes simultaneously. This is achieved by managing how processes share the central processing unit (CPU), ensuring that each process gets a chance to execute within a specific time frame, thereby creating the illusion of concurrent execution. Multitasking increases the efficiency of CPU usage by organizing CPU time among multiple processes.</p>
                </article>

                <article id="basis-of-time-division">
                    <h4>Basis of Time Division</h4>
                    <p>Time division is a fundamental principle used in multitasking operating systems to allocate CPU time among multiple processes. The CPU time is divided into discrete intervals known as time slices or quantum. Each process is allowed to execute for a specified quantum before the next process is scheduled to run. This time-sharing mechanism ensures fair CPU allocation, enabling multiple processes to run seemingly in parallel on a single CPU.</p>

            <article id="network-and-ip-addresses">
                <h3>Network and IP Addresses</h3>
                <p>An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. IP addresses serve two main functions: host or network interface identification and location addressing. Understanding IP addresses is crucial for networking, as they ensure that data reaches its correct destination across networks.</p>

                <article>
                    <h4>IP Address Structure</h4>
                    <p>IP addresses are composed of two main parts: the network part and the host part. The network part identifies the specific network on which a device is located, while the host part identifies the specific device on that network. There are two versions of IP addresses commonly in use: IPv4 and IPv6. IPv4 addresses are 32 bits long, divided into four octets, and represented in decimal format. IPv6 addresses are 128 bits long, divided into eight 16-bit blocks, and represented in hexadecimal format to accommodate a vastly larger number of devices.</p>

                <article>
                    <h4>Classes</h4>
                    <p>IP addresses are categorized into classes based on the first octet, which helps in identifying the network size. There are five classes in total, A through E, but for most practical purposes, Classes A, B, and C are most relevant.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Class A</strong>: Supports 16 million hosts on each of 128 networks. It's identified by a first octet range of 1-126.</li>
                        <li><strong>Class B</strong>: Supports 65,000 hosts on each of 16,000 networks. Identified by a first octet range of 128-191.</li>
                        <li><strong>Class C</strong>: Supports 254 hosts on each of 2 million networks. Identified by a first octet range of 192-223.</li>

                </article>

                <article>
                    <h4>Range</h4>
                    <p>Each IP class has a specific range of addresses that it can accommodate, determined by the network's first octet. The range defines the possible network and host combinations.</p>

                <h3>Role of the Dispatcher in the Process State Change</h3>
                <p>The dispatcher is a component of the operating system's scheduler responsible for the actual process of context switching from one process to another. Its primary role is to switch the CPU from the context of a currently running process to the context of the next process to run, based on the scheduling algorithm in use.</p>
                <p>When the scheduler decides to execute a different process (during a state change from Ready to Running), the dispatcher performs the following actions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Saves the state of the currently running process (including its program counter, CPU registers, and other execution contexts) into its Process Control Block (PCB).</li>
                    <li>Loads the state of the next process to run from its PCB into the CPU registers, updating the program counter to resume its execution.</li>
                    <li>Transfers control to the selected process, effectively changing the process state to Running.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This mechanism is crucial for multitasking, allowing the OS to manage multiple processes efficiently, ensuring that each process gets a fair share of CPU time, and facilitating the seamless execution of numerous tasks.</p>

            <article id="introduction-to-process-creation-and-states">
                <h3>Introduction to Process Creation and States</h3>
                <p>Process creation is a fundamental operation in operating systems, marking the inception of a new process. This involves allocating a unique Process ID (PID), allocating memory, and initializing process control structures. Processes transition through various states from creation to termination, influenced by scheduling decisions and system events. These states include New, Ready, Running, and Blocked/Wait, each reflecting the process's current status in the system.</p>

                <article id="process-vs-processing">
                    <h4>Process vs. Processing</h4>
                    <p>A process is an instance of a program in execution, characterized by its code, data, and state. It is an active entity with a program counter indicating the next instruction to execute and a set of associated resources. Processing, on the other hand, refers to the series of actions executed by the CPU to perform a task, such as executing instructions, performing calculations, and managing data transfers.</p>
                    <p>A <strong>process</strong> is a dynamic instance of an executable program, with its current state, data, and executing context, such as the values in its program counter, registers, and memory. It represents a single task or program in execution, encapsulated within its own virtual address space and system resources allocated by the operating system (OS). The OS manages processes through various states of execution, ensuring efficient CPU usage and multitasking capabilities.</p>
                    <p><strong>Processing</strong>, conversely, refers to the action performed by a computer's CPU—the execution of instructions that make up a program or process. Processing involves arithmetic calculations, logical operations, data transfer, and control flow management, executing the sequence of instructions that constitute the software being run. While a process is an entity, processing is an activity, signifying the work the CPU undertakes to perform tasks and execute programs.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>From New to Ready</strong>: Once the long-term scheduler decides to admit a new process into the system, it transitions from the New state to the Ready state, where it waits for the short-term scheduler to allocate the CPU.</li>
                        <li><strong>From Ready to Running</strong>: The short-term scheduler selects a process from the Ready queue and allocates the CPU to it, changing its state to Running.</li>
                        <li><strong>From Running to Waiting/Blocked</strong>: If the process requires an I/O operation or needs to wait for a resource, it transitions from Running to the Waiting/Blocked state, releasing the CPU.</li>
                        <li><strong>From Waiting/Blocked to Ready</strong>: Once the I/O operation is complete or the awaited resource becomes available, the process transitions back to the Ready state, waiting for the CPU to be allocated again.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Long-term Scheduler</strong> (or Job Scheduler): Decides which jobs or processes are admitted to the system for processing. It controls the degree of multiprogramming, i.e., the number of processes in memory. The long-term scheduler determines when to move new processes to the ready state.</li>
                        <li><strong>Short-term Scheduler</strong> (or CPU Scheduler): Selects from among the processes that are ready to execute and allocates the CPU to one of them. It's invoked frequently and must be fast, as it affects the system's responsiveness and performance directly.</li>
                        <li><strong>Medium-term Scheduler</strong> (or Swapper): Temporarily removes processes from active contention for the CPU to control the level of multiprogramming. This scheduler may swap out processes to disk, moving them from the waiting state back to the ready state, or vice versa, to balance the mix of CPU-bound and I/O-bound processes.</li>

                    <p>Time slice allocation, also known as quantum, is a critical aspect of the Round Robin (RR) scheduling algorithm used by the STS. A time slice is a fixed time period allocated to each process in the ready queue before the CPU is switched to another process. The allocation of time slices ensures that each process gets a fair share of CPU time, preventing any single process from monopolizing the CPU. The length of the time slice can significantly affect system performance, with shorter slices leading to higher context switch overhead but more responsive system behavior, and longer slices reducing context switch overhead but potentially leading to less responsive behavior for interactive processes.</p>
