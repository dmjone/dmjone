                <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
                <p>In the year 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic posed a severe challenge globally, including in India. As the virus spread across various cities, public health officials and authorities faced the critical task of managing and containing the outbreak. To effectively allocate resources and implement quarantine measures, they needed to analyze the extent of infection spread within each city.</p>
                <p>Imagine you are a public health official tasked with managing the COVID-19 pandemic in Mumbai. You have received a 2D map of the city, but the data collection was not done systematically, so instead of total counts of infected cases in each area, the map includes information on COVID-19 infections in the following format:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>'1' denotes a person with an active COVID-19 virus.</li>
                    <li>'0' denotes a person with a negative COVID-19 virus.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Your task is to identify neighbourhoods with the highest COVID-19 virus, where a neighbourhood denotes a cluster of people with an active COVID-19 virus and the connection between these people on the map is either horizontal or vertical.</p>
                <p>Identify the neighbourhood with the highest COVID-19 virus and return the population of that neighbourhood.</p>

                <h4>Input Format</h4>
                <p>The first line of input contains one integer <em>t</em>, which is the number of test cases.</p>
                <p>Each test case has the following input:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The first line contains two space-separated integers <em>m</em> and <em>n</em>, where <em>m × n</em> denotes the size of the map provided to you, with <em>m</em> denoting the number of rows and <em>n</em> denoting the number of columns.</li>
                    <li>The next <em>m</em> lines each have <em>n</em> space-separated integers representing the map of the city.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>

                <ul>
                    <li><em>1 ≤ t ≤ 100</em></li>
                    <li><em>1 ≤ m, n ≤ 100</em></li>

            <article>
                <h4>Output Format</h4>
                <p>For each test case, print a single integer, denoting the population of the largest neighbourhood.</p>

                <h4>Explanation</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>In the first test case, there is one large cluster (or neighbourhood) of infected individuals. The population of this neighbourhood is 9, so the output is 9.</li>
                    <li>In the second test case, there are three neighbourhoods of infected individuals with population sizes of 1, 2, and 4. The largest neighbourhood has a population of 4, so the output is 4.</li>
