                <h3>1. Problem Description</h3>
                <p>Your family is planning a memorable trip to Thailand to visit its beautiful islands. These islands are part of different archipelagos, each with its unique beauty. The islands within an archipelago are connected by boat tours, allowing travel from one island to another within the same archipelago. However, there are no boat tours connecting islands in different archipelagos.</p>
                <p>You are given the number of islands and the boat tours between them. Each island is numbered from 1 to the total number of islands. If a boat tour exists between island <em>u</em> and island <em>v</em>, it is assumed that a return boat trip also exists.</p>
                <p>Your task is to determine how many separate archipelagos exist, given the information about the islands and the boat tours.</p>

                <h4>1.6 Explanation</h4>
                <p>In the given example, there are 12 islands. The boat tours connect some of these islands, forming several archipelagos:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Islands 1, 2, and 3 form one archipelago.</li>
                    <li>Islands 4, 5, and 6 form another archipelago.</li>
                    <li>Islands 7, 8, 9, and 10 form a third archipelago.</li>
                    <li>Island 11 does not have any boat tours connecting it to other islands, making it an isolated archipelago.</li>
                    <li>Island 12 is also isolated, forming its own archipelago.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Thus, there are a total of 5 archipelagos in this scenario.</p>
