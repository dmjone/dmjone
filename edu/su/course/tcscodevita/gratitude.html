                <p>Dear TCS CodeVita Organizing Team,                </p>
                <p>I write this letter with immense gratitude and a heart brimming with appreciation for the incredible journey that you orchestrated. The TCS CodeVita Grand Finale was not just a contest—it was an experience, a lesson, and a celebration of the finest minds in competitive programming.                </p>
                <p>From the moment we arrived, we were welcomed with warmth and guided with care. Vishwanath ji, from day one, ensured that we felt at home, making our transition into this grand event seamless. Rachel, with her meticulous attention to every detail, made sure that not a single query went unanswered—from the first congratulatory email to every logistical concern, she stood as our anchor. Bablu, with his perfect blend of discipline and enthusiasm, made sure that our journey was as structured as it was enjoyable.                </p>
                <p>And then, there was Jagan sir and his team—the masterminds behind the questions that truly tested our limits. Though the problems were formidable, they were a lesson in themselves. I may not have performed as well as I hoped, but I walk away with something far greater than a rank—an unshakable resolve to push my limits, an enriched mind, and the realization that challenges, no matter how daunting, are merely stepping stones toward growth.                </p>
                <p>Beyond the contest, the very essence of CodeVita—bringing together brilliant minds from across the world—was nothing short of inspiring. Conversations with fellow coders, late-night discussions, and the camaraderie forged in those intense hours of problem-solving are memories I will cherish forever.                </p>
                <p>The stay at Taj Vivanta was not just comfortable; it was an experience in itself. The hospitality, the grandeur, and the serenity allowed us to focus, recharge, and immerse ourselves completely in this competition. And then there was the TCS campus—a marvel of engineering, an embodiment of vision, and a place that radiated excellence at every corner. Walking through its corridors, one couldn’t help but be inspired by the sheer ingenuity that it represents.                </p>
                <p>Out of 537,000+ participants, to be a part of this prestigious finale was a privilege. While I may not have emerged victorious in the rankings, I leave with something more profound—a renewed spirit, a heart full of gratitude, and the unwavering belief that every experience, whether a triumph or a lesson, contributes to the journey ahead.                </p>
                <p>To every individual who worked tirelessly behind the scenes, who made sleepless nights their routine to ensure our experience was seamless and memorable—I salute you. You didn’t just organize a competition; you curated a transformative experience that will stay with us forever.                </p>

                <p>Thank you, from the depths of my heart, for making this possible. This is not just a farewell—it’s a promise. A promise to return, stronger, wiser, and ever more determined.</p>
                
                <p>With deepest gratitude,</p>
                <p>Divya Mohan</p>
                <p>TCS CodeVita Grand Finale Participant</p>
