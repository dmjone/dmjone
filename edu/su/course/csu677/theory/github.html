				<h3>2. Setting Up GitHub</h3>
				<p>To start using GitHub, you need to create an account and set up your local development environment to interact with GitHub repositories.</p>

				<h4>2.1 Creating a GitHub Account</h4>
				<p>To create an account on GitHub, visit <a href="https://github.com">github.com</a> and sign up using your email address. Once registered, you can create repositories, follow other developers, and contribute to projects.</p>

				<h4>2.2 Configuring Git for GitHub</h4>
				<p>After creating a GitHub account, configure Git on your local machine to work with GitHub. This involves setting your username and email, which will be associated with your commits.</p>

				<h5>2.2.1 Example: Configuring Git for GitHub</h5>
				<pre><code class="language-bash">
# Set your GitHub username
git config --global user.name "Your Name"

# Set your GitHub email
git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"
</code></pre>

				<h4>2.3 SSH Key Setup</h4>
				<p>To securely connect to GitHub without repeatedly entering your username and password, you can use SSH keys. This is especially useful when you are working with multiple repositories or frequently pushing and pulling changes.</p>

				<h5>2.3.1 Example: Generating and Adding an SSH Key to GitHub</h5>
				<pre><code class="language-bash">
# Generate a new SSH key
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "youremail@example.com"

# Add the SSH key to your GitHub account
# Copy the key to your clipboard
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | pbcopy

# Go to GitHub > Settings > SSH and GPG keys > New SSH key
# Paste the key and save
</code></pre>

				<h3>3. Working with GitHub Repositories</h3>
				<p>GitHub repositories are the core component where your projects and their version history are stored. You can create, clone, and manage repositories directly from GitHub or using Git commands.</p>

				<h4>3.1 Creating a Repository</h4>
				<p>To create a new repository on GitHub, you can use the GitHub web interface or Git command-line tools. When creating a repository, you can choose to make it public (anyone can view it) or private (only you and collaborators can access it).</p>

				<h5>3.1.1 Example: Creating a Repository on GitHub</h5>
				<pre><code class="language-bash">
# Create a new repository using the GitHub web interface
# Navigate to your GitHub profile and click "New" under Repositories
# Fill in the repository name, description, and choose visibility
# Optionally, initialize the repository with a README file
</code></pre>

				<h4>3.2 Cloning a Repository</h4>
				<p>Cloning a repository means creating a local copy of the remote GitHub repository. This allows you to work on the project locally and then push your changes back to the GitHub repository.</p>

				<h5>3.2.1 Example: Cloning a GitHub Repository</h5>
				<pre><code class="language-bash">
# Clone a repository using HTTPS
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git

# Clone a repository using SSH
git clone git@github.com:username/repository.git
</code></pre>

				<h4>3.3 Forking a Repository</h4>
				<p>Forking is a GitHub feature that allows you to create a personal copy of someone else’s repository. Forking is commonly used to propose changes to someone else’s project or to use someone else’s project as a starting point for your own idea.</p>

				<h5>3.3.1 Example: Forking a Repository on GitHub</h5>
				<pre><code class="language-bash">
# Go to the repository you want to fork on GitHub
# Click the "Fork" button at the top right corner of the page
# This creates a copy of the repository under your GitHub account
</code></pre>

				<h3>4. Collaboration on GitHub</h3>
				<p>GitHub provides several features to facilitate collaboration among developers, including issues, pull requests, and project boards. These tools help teams manage code changes, discuss improvements, and track project progress.</p>

				<h4>4.1 Issues</h4>
				<p>Issues are used to track bugs, feature requests, and other tasks in a repository. GitHub Issues allow you to label, assign, and comment on tasks, making it easier to manage and prioritize work.</p>

				<h5>4.1.1 Example: Creating an Issue on GitHub</h5>
				<pre><code class="language-bash">
# Navigate to the "Issues" tab in your GitHub repository
# Click "New issue" and fill in the title and description
# Optionally, assign the issue to a team member and add labels
</code></pre>

				<h4>4.2 Pull Requests</h4>
				<p>A pull request (PR) is a way to propose changes to a repository. When you create a pull request, you're asking the repository maintainer to review and merge your changes into the main codebase. Pull requests also allow for code review, discussions, and automated testing before merging.</p>

				<h5>4.2.1 Example: Creating a Pull Request on GitHub</h5>
				<pre><code class="language-bash">
# After committing your changes to a branch in your forked repository
# Navigate to the original repository on GitHub
# Click "New pull request" and select the branches to compare
# Review your changes, add comments, and submit the pull request
</code></pre>

				<h4>4.3 Project Boards</h4>
				<p>GitHub Project Boards are used to organize and prioritize work in a visual format. You can create boards to manage issues, pull requests, and notes across multiple repositories or for a single repository.</p>

				<h5>4.3.1 Example: Setting Up a Project Board on GitHub</h5>
				<pre><code class="language-bash">
# Navigate to the "Projects" tab in your GitHub repository
# Click "New project" and choose between a basic Kanban board or a custom template
# Add columns such as "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done"
# Drag and drop issues and pull requests to track their progress
</code></pre>

				<h3>5. GitHub Actions</h3>
				<p>GitHub Actions is a CI/CD platform that automates the build, test, and deployment process of your code. With GitHub Actions, you can define workflows that are triggered by specific events, such as pushing code to a repository or creating a pull request.</p>

				<h4>5.1 Creating a Workflow</h4>
				<p>A workflow is a YAML file that defines the automation process. Workflows are stored in the <code>.github/workflows</code> directory of your repository. You can create workflows for tasks like running tests, deploying applications, or automating repetitive tasks.</p>

				<h5>5.1.1 Example: A Basic CI Workflow</h5>
				<pre><code class="language-yaml">
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: '14'
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm install
    - name: Run tests
      run: npm test
</code></pre>

				<h4>5.2 Reusing Workflows</h4>
				<p>GitHub allows you to reuse workflows across multiple repositories, making it easier to manage common tasks like testing and deployment. Reusable workflows reduce duplication and simplify the maintenance of CI/CD pipelines.</p>

				<h5>5.2.1 Example: Reusing a Workflow</h5>
				<pre><code class="language-yaml">
# .github/workflows/main.yml
name: Main

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  test:
    uses: username/repo/.github/workflows/test.yml@main
</code></pre>
