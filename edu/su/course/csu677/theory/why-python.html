                <h3>1. What Is Python?</h3>
                <p>Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its clear syntax, readability, and versatility. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant whitespace. This allows developers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be possible in languages such as C++ or Java.</p>

            <article id="why-python-was-required">
                <h3>2. Why Python Was Required</h3>
                <p>The inception of Python was driven by a desire to create a language that combined the best elements of existing languages while addressing their shortcomings. Its creator, Guido van Rossum, sought to design a language that was both powerful and easy to read, making programming more accessible and reducing the learning curve for beginners. Python's simplicity and elegance were intended to foster clear programming on both small and large scales.</p>

                <h3>3. When Was Python Made and Who Made It?</h3>
                <p>Python was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Van Rossum, a Dutch programmer, started working on Python during Christmas in 1989 as a hobby project. He aimed to make a successor to the ABC language that would appeal to Unix/C hackers. Van Rossum has been affectionately known as Python's "Benevolent Dictator For Life" (BDFL), a title he held until he stepped down from the position in 2018.</p>
