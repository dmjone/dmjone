				<h3>1. Introduction to Cookies</h3>
				<p>Cookies are small text files that are stored on a user's device by a web browser at the request of a web server. They are used to store data that can be sent back to the server with subsequent requests, enabling the server to maintain stateful information across page requests or sessions. This allows for a more personalized and interactive user experience on the web.</p>
			</article>

			<article>
				<h3>2. Structure of a Cookie</h3>
				<p>A cookie typically consists of several components:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Name:</strong> The name of the cookie, which is used to identify it.</li>
					<li><strong>Value:</strong> The data stored in the cookie, which is associated with the name.</li>
					<li><strong>Domain:</strong> Specifies the domain for which the cookie is valid. The cookie will be sent to this domain with each request.</li>
					<li><strong>Path:</strong> The URL path that must exist in the requested URL for the browser to send the cookie.</li>
					<li><strong>Expiration Date:</strong> The date and time when the cookie will expire. After this point, the cookie will be deleted by the browser. If no expiration date is provided, the cookie is considered a session cookie and will be deleted when the browser is closed.</li>
					<li><strong>Secure Flag:</strong> Indicates that the cookie should only be sent over secure HTTPS connections.</li>
					<li><strong>HttpOnly Flag:</strong> When set, this flag prevents client-side scripts from accessing the cookie, reducing the risk of cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.</li>
					<li><strong>SameSite Flag:</strong> Controls whether the cookie is sent with cross-site requests, helping to mitigate cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks.</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>3. Types of Cookies</h3>
				<p>Cookies can be categorized based on their lifespan, usage, and scope:</p>

				<h4>3.1 Session Cookies</h4>
				<p>Session cookies are temporary cookies that are created and stored only during a user's browsing session. They are automatically deleted when the browser is closed. Session cookies are commonly used to manage user sessions, such as keeping a user logged in as they navigate through a website.</p>

				<h4>3.2 Persistent Cookies</h4>
				<p>Persistent cookies remain on the user's device even after the browser is closed, until they reach their specified expiration date or are manually deleted by the user. These cookies are used to remember user preferences, login details, or other data that needs to persist across sessions.</p>

				<h4>3.3 First-Party Cookies</h4>
				<p>First-party cookies are set by the website the user is currently visiting. They are typically used to store information that improves the user experience on that specific site, such as language settings or shopping cart contents.</p>

				<h4>3.4 Third-Party Cookies</h4>
				<p>Third-party cookies are set by domains other than the one the user is currently visiting, often through embedded content like ads or social media widgets. These cookies are commonly used for tracking and advertising purposes, enabling advertisers to build profiles of users based on their browsing behavior across multiple sites.</p>
			</article>

				<h3>4. How Cookies Work</h3>
				<p>When a user visits a website, the server can send one or more cookies to the user's browser along with the response. The browser stores these cookies and includes them in subsequent requests to the same server. This allows the server to recognize the user and maintain continuity across multiple requests.</p>

				<h4>4.1 Example: Setting and Retrieving a Cookie</h4>
				<pre><code class="language-http">
// Server response setting a cookie
Set-Cookie: user=Divya; Expires=Wed, 09 Aug 2024 12:00:00 GMT; Path=/; Secure; HttpOnly

// Client request sending the cookie back to the server
GET /profile HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Cookie: user=Divya
</code></pre>

				<p>In this example, the server sets a cookie named <code>user</code> with the value <code>Divya</code>. The cookie is set to expire on a specific date, is restricted to the <code>/</code> path, and is marked as secure and HTTP-only. On subsequent requests, the browser automatically includes the cookie in the request headers, allowing the server to identify the user.</p>

				<h3>5. Use Cases for Cookies</h3>
				<p>Cookies serve various purposes on the web, enhancing user experience and enabling certain functionalities:</p>

				<h4>5.1 Session Management</h4>
				<p>Cookies are widely used for session management, such as keeping users logged in as they navigate through a website. When a user logs in, the server creates a session identifier and stores it in a cookie. This cookie is then sent with every request, allowing the server to identify the user and maintain the session.</p>

				<h4>5.2 Personalization</h4>
				<p>Cookies enable websites to remember user preferences and provide a personalized experience. For example, a website can use cookies to remember a user's language preference or the items in their shopping cart, even if they leave the site and return later.</p>

				<h4>5.3 Tracking and Analytics</h4>
				<p>Cookies are commonly used to track user behavior on a website, such as page views, time spent on the site, and navigation patterns. This information is valuable for website owners to improve their services and tailor content to user interests. Third-party cookies are often used for tracking across multiple sites, enabling advertisers to deliver targeted ads.</p>

				<h3>6. Security Concerns with Cookies</h3>
				<p>While cookies are useful, they also pose several security risks if not properly managed:</p>

				<h4>6.1 Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)</h4>
				<p>If a website is vulnerable to XSS attacks, an attacker can inject malicious scripts that steal cookies from the user's browser. These cookies may contain sensitive information, such as session identifiers, which can be used to impersonate the user. To mitigate this risk, cookies can be marked as <code>HttpOnly</code>, preventing them from being accessed by client-side scripts.</p>

				<h4>6.2 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)</h4>
				<p>CSRF attacks occur when an attacker tricks a user into making unwanted requests to a website where they are authenticated. Since cookies are automatically included with requests, the server may process the request as if it were legitimate. To prevent CSRF, developers can use the <code>SameSite</code> flag on cookies, restricting them to same-site requests only.</p>

				<h4>6.3 Cookie Theft and Session Hijacking</h4>
				<p>Cookies can be stolen through various means, such as packet sniffing over unsecured networks or malware. If a session cookie is stolen, an attacker can hijack the user's session and gain unauthorized access to their account. Using the <code>Secure</code> flag ensures that cookies are only sent over HTTPS, protecting them from being intercepted over unsecured connections.</p>

				<h3>7. Managing Cookies</h3>
				<p>Browsers provide users with tools to manage cookies, allowing them to view, delete, or block cookies as needed:</p>

				<h4>7.1 Viewing Cookies</h4>
				<p>Users can view the cookies stored by their browser through the browser's developer tools. This allows them to see which cookies are being used by different websites and what data is stored in them.</p>

				<h4>7.2 Deleting Cookies</h4>
				<p>Browsers allow users to delete individual cookies or clear all cookies for a specific website or across all sites. This can be useful for troubleshooting, privacy management, or simply starting a fresh session.</p>

				<h4>7.3 Blocking Cookies</h4>
				<p>Users can configure their browser settings to block cookies from specific sites or entirely. While this enhances privacy, it may also limit functionality on certain websites that rely on cookies for essential features, such as logging in or maintaining session state.</p>

				<h3>8. Cookie Best Practices</h3>
				<p>To ensure cookies are used securely and effectively, developers should follow these best practices:</p>

				<h4>8.1 Use the <code>HttpOnly</code> Flag</h4>
				<p>Mark cookies as <code>HttpOnly</code> to prevent them from being accessed via JavaScript. This reduces the risk of cookie theft through XSS attacks.</p>

				<h4>8.2 Implement the <code>SameSite</code> Attribute</h4>
				<p>Use the <code>SameSite</code> attribute to restrict cookies to same-site requests, mitigating the risk of CSRF attacks. The <code>Strict</code> mode ensures that cookies are only sent in a first-party context, while the <code>Lax</code> mode allows for safe cross-site use.</p>

				<h4>8.3 Encrypt Sensitive Data</h4>
				<p>If sensitive information must be stored in cookies, ensure it is encrypted before storing. However, it's generally recommended to avoid storing sensitive data in cookies whenever possible.</p>

				<h4>8.4 Set Appropriate Expiry Dates</h4>
				<p>Set expiry dates for cookies that reflect their intended use. For session cookies, avoid setting an expiry date so they are automatically deleted when the browser is closed. For persistent cookies, choose a reasonable expiration period based on the data being stored.</p>

				<h4>8.5 Regularly Review and Clean Up Cookies</h4>
				<p>Regularly review the cookies set by your application to ensure that they are still necessary and that their settings align with your security policies. Remove any outdated or unnecessary cookies to minimize potential attack surfaces.</p>

				<h3>9. Legal and Privacy Considerations</h3>
				<p>Cookies are subject to various legal and privacy regulations, particularly in regions with strict data protection laws, such as the European Union.</p>

				<h4>9.1 Cookie Consent</h4>
				<p>Under regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), websites must obtain user consent before setting cookies, especially for those used for tracking or advertising purposes. This is typically achieved through a cookie consent banner or pop-up that allows users to accept or decline the use of cookies.</p>

				<h4>9.2 Cookie Policies</h4>
				<p>Websites are required to provide clear information about their use of cookies, including what data is collected, how it is used, and who it is shared with. This information is usually presented in a cookie policy, which should be easily accessible to users.</p>

				<h4>9.3 Compliance with Privacy Laws</h4>
				<p>To comply with privacy laws, ensure that your website's use of cookies aligns with the legal requirements of the regions where your users are located. This may involve adjusting cookie settings, updating privacy policies, and implementing tools for managing user consent.</p>
