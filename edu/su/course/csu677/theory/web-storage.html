				<h3>1. Introduction to Web Storage</h3>
				<p>Web Storage is a feature provided by web browsers that allows websites to store data on the client-side, within the user's browser. Unlike cookies, Web Storage offers a more straightforward and larger storage mechanism, making it ideal for storing data that needs to persist across sessions or pages without being sent to the server with every request.</p>
			</article>

			<article>
				<h3>2. Types of Web Storage</h3>
				<p>Web Storage is divided into two types: <strong>Local Storage</strong> and <strong>Session Storage</strong>. Both serve different purposes based on the longevity and scope of the data being stored.</p>

				<h4>2.1 Local Storage</h4>
				<p>Local Storage is designed to store data that persists even after the browser is closed and reopened. Data stored in Local Storage is accessible across multiple tabs and windows of the same browser, and it remains until explicitly deleted by the user or the application.</p>

				<h5>2.1.1 Example: Using Local Storage</h5>
				<pre><code class="language-javascript">
// Storing data in Local Storage
localStorage.setItem('username', 'Divya');

// Retrieving data from Local Storage
const username = localStorage.getItem('username');
console.log(username); // Output: Divya

// Removing data from Local Storage
localStorage.removeItem('username');

// Clearing all data from Local Storage
localStorage.clear();
</code></pre>

				<h4>2.2 Session Storage</h4>
				<p>Session Storage is intended for data that only needs to persist for the duration of the page session. The data is specific to the tab or window in which it was created, meaning it is not shared between tabs or windows. Once the tab or window is closed, the data is deleted.</p>

				<h5>2.2.1 Example: Using Session Storage</h5>
				<pre><code class="language-javascript">
// Storing data in Session Storage
sessionStorage.setItem('sessionID', '123456');

// Retrieving data from Session Storage
const sessionID = sessionStorage.getItem('sessionID');
console.log(sessionID); // Output: 123456

// Removing data from Session Storage
sessionStorage.removeItem('sessionID');

// Clearing all data from Session Storage
sessionStorage.clear();
</code></pre>

				<h3>3. Differences Between Cookies and Web Storage</h3>
				<p>While cookies have been the traditional method for storing data on the client-side, Web Storage offers several advantages over cookies. Understanding these differences is crucial for deciding which method to use in a web application.</p>

				<h4>3.1 Storage Capacity</h4>
				<p>Cookies are limited to about 4KB of data per cookie, while Web Storage allows for much larger storage (typically 5MB per domain in most browsers). This makes Web Storage more suitable for storing larger amounts of data.</p>

				<h4>3.2 Data Transmission</h4>
				<p>Cookies are sent to the server with every HTTP request, which can impact performance, especially if a large amount of data is stored in cookies. In contrast, data stored in Web Storage is not automatically sent to the server, reducing unnecessary data transmission and improving performance.</p>

				<h4>3.3 Accessibility</h4>
				<p>Cookies are accessible to both the server and the client, whereas Web Storage is only accessible to the client-side scripts running in the browser. This provides a more secure way to store data that does not need to be sent to the server.</p>

				<h4>3.4 Expiry</h4>
				<p>Cookies can be set to expire at a specific date and time, while data in Local Storage persists until explicitly deleted. Session Storage data, on the other hand, is automatically cleared when the session ends.</p>

				<h3>4. Security Considerations for Web Storage</h3>
				<p>While Web Storage provides a powerful mechanism for storing data on the client-side, it is important to consider the security implications of using it.</p>

				<h4>4.1 Sensitive Data</h4>
				<p>Web Storage should not be used to store sensitive information, such as passwords or credit card details, as it is accessible through JavaScript and can be exploited if the website is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. Always store sensitive data securely on the server-side.</p>

				<h4>4.2 Data Tampering</h4>
				<p>Data stored in Web Storage can be modified or deleted by users through their browser's developer tools. Therefore, do not rely on the integrity of data stored in Web Storage for critical application functionality.</p>

				<h4>4.3 XSS Attacks</h4>
				<p>Web Storage is susceptible to XSS attacks, where an attacker injects malicious scripts into the web page to steal or manipulate stored data. To mitigate this risk, always sanitize and validate user input and implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.</p>

				<h3>5. Practical Use Cases for Web Storage</h3>
				<p>Web Storage is versatile and can be used in various scenarios where client-side data persistence is needed. Here are some common use cases:</p>

				<h4>5.1 Storing User Preferences</h4>
				<p>Web Storage can be used to store user preferences, such as theme selection (light or dark mode), language settings, or layout configurations. This allows the preferences to persist across sessions, providing a personalized user experience.</p>

				<h5>5.1.1 Example: Storing Theme Preference</h5>
				<pre><code class="language-javascript">
// Saving the user's theme preference
localStorage.setItem('theme', 'dark');

// Applying the saved theme on page load
const savedTheme = localStorage.getItem('theme');
if (savedTheme) {
    document.body.classList.add(savedTheme);
}
</code></pre>

				<h4>5.2 Caching API Responses</h4>
				<p>For web applications that make frequent API calls, caching the responses in Web Storage can reduce the number of requests made to the server, improving performance and reducing load times.</p>

				<h5>5.2.1 Example: Caching API Response</h5>
				<pre><code class="language-javascript">
const apiURL = 'https://api.example.com/data';
const cachedData = localStorage.getItem('apiData');

if (cachedData) {
    console.log('Using cached data:', JSON.parse(cachedData));
} else {
    fetch(apiURL)
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(data => {
            localStorage.setItem('apiData', JSON.stringify(data));
            console.log('Fetched and cached data:', data);
        });
}
</code></pre>

				<h4>5.3 Implementing a Simple Shopping Cart</h4>
				<p>Web Storage can be used to implement a simple shopping cart that persists even if the user navigates away from the page or closes the browser. This ensures that items added to the cart remain until the user checks out or clears the cart.</p>

				<h5>5.3.1 Example: Simple Shopping Cart</h5>
				<pre><code class="language-javascript">
// Adding an item to the cart
let cart = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('cart')) || [];
cart.push({ id: 1, name: 'Product 1', quantity: 1 });
localStorage.setItem('cart', JSON.stringify(cart));

// Retrieving and displaying the cart items
cart = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('cart')) || [];
console.log('Shopping Cart:', cart);
</code></pre>

				<h3>6. Browser Support and Limitations of Web Storage</h3>
				<p>Web Storage is widely supported across modern web browsers, making it a reliable option for client-side data storage. However, there are some limitations and considerations to keep in mind:</p>

				<h4>6.1 Storage Limits</h4>
				<p>The storage limit for Local Storage and Session Storage is typically around 5MB per origin, although this can vary depending on the browser. Exceeding this limit will result in a <code>QUOTA_EXCEEDED_ERR</code> exception.</p>

				<h4>6.2 Lack of Server Interaction</h4>
				<p>Data stored in Web Storage is only accessible to client-side scripts and is not automatically synchronized with the server. This means that for scenarios where data needs to be shared across multiple devices or sessions, other mechanisms such as server-side storage or databases should be used.</p>

				<h4>6.3 Security Concerns</h4>
				<p>As mentioned earlier, Web Storage is susceptible to security vulnerabilities such as XSS attacks. Developers should be cautious about what data is stored in Web Storage and implement proper security measures to protect against potential exploits.</p>
			</article>

				<h3>7. Best Practices for Using Web Storage</h3>
				<p>To make the most of Web Storage while ensuring security and performance, developers should follow these best practices:</p>

				<h4>7.1 Store Only Non-Sensitive Data</h4>
				<p>Web Storage should be reserved for non-sensitive data, such as user preferences, caching non-critical data, or temporary state management. Sensitive information should always be stored securely on the server side.</p>

				<h4>7.2 Implement Expiry Mechanisms</h4>
				<p>Since Web Storage data does not expire automatically, it is a good practice to implement custom expiration mechanisms. This can be done by storing a timestamp along with the data and checking it before use to determine if the data should be refreshed or discarded.</p>

				<h5>7.2.1 Example: Implementing Expiry in Local Storage

				</h5>
				<pre><code class="language-javascript">
// Storing data with an expiry time (e.g., 1 hour)
const data = { value: 'someData', expiry: Date.now() + 3600 * 1000 };
localStorage.setItem('expirableData', JSON.stringify(data));

// Retrieving and checking if the data has expired
const storedData = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('expirableData'));
if (storedData && Date.now() < storedData.expiry) {
    console.log('Data is still valid:', storedData.value);
} else {
    console.log('Data has expired');
    localStorage.removeItem('expirableData');
}
</code></pre>

				<h4>7.3 Regularly Clear Unused Data</h4>
				<p>Over time, Web Storage can accumulate unused or outdated data, which can consume unnecessary space. Implementing regular checks and clearing old or unnecessary data helps maintain optimal performance and storage usage.</p>

				<h4>7.4 Avoid Storing Large Amounts of Data</h4>
				<p>While Web Storage can handle larger data sizes compared to cookies, it's still limited and should not be used as a substitute for databases or other storage mechanisms designed for large datasets. Keep the storage lean to avoid running into storage limits or performance issues.</p>
