                <h3>Introduction to Web Technology</h3>
                <p>Web Technology encompasses the tools and techniques that enable the creation and maintenance of websites and web applications. It forms the backbone of how we interact with the internet, providing the means to present content, process data, and communicate across vast networks.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h3>1. Key Components</h3>
                <p>Web technology is built on several key components, each serving a distinct role in the functioning of the web:</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h4>1.1 HTML (HyperText Markup Language)</h4>
                <p>HTML is the foundation of web pages, defining the structure and content that users see and interact with.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Elements</strong>: Basic building blocks like headings, paragraphs, links, and images.</li>
                    <li><strong>Attributes</strong>: Additional properties added to elements to provide more detail, such as `id`, `class`, and `href`.</li>
                    <li><strong>Document Object Model (DOM)</strong>: A representation of the structure of a web page that can be manipulated with programming languages like JavaScript.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>1.2 CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</h4>
                <p>CSS is responsible for the visual styling of web pages, controlling the layout, colors, fonts, and overall presentation.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Selectors</strong>: Patterns used to target HTML elements for styling, such as classes, IDs, and element names.</li>
                    <li><strong>Properties</strong>: The characteristics applied to elements, like `color`, `font-size`, and `margin`.</li>
                    <li><strong>Box Model</strong>: The concept that each element is a rectangular box, including the content, padding, border, and margin.</li>
                    <li><strong>Responsive Design</strong>: Techniques to make web pages adaptable to different screen sizes and devices, such as media queries and flexible grid layouts.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>1.3 JavaScript</h4>
                <p>JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Variables and Data Types</strong>: Storing and manipulating data using various types like strings, numbers, and objects.</li>
                    <li><strong>Functions</strong>: Blocks of reusable code that perform specific tasks when called.</li>
                    <li><strong>DOM Manipulation</strong>: Changing the structure, content, and style of web pages dynamically using JavaScript.</li>
                    <li><strong>Events</strong>: Actions or occurrences that JavaScript can respond to, such as clicks, key presses, and form submissions.</li>
                    <li><strong>APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)</strong>: Interfaces that allow JavaScript to interact with external services, such as retrieving data from a server.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>1.4 Web Servers</h4>
                <p>Web servers are responsible for handling requests from clients (browsers) and serving the appropriate content.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>HTTP Protocol</strong>: The standard communication protocol used by web servers and clients to exchange information.</li>
                    <li><strong>Static vs. Dynamic Content</strong>: Serving fixed files like HTML pages (static) vs. generating content on-the-fly based on user input or other factors (dynamic).</li>
                    <li><strong>Server-Side Languages</strong>: Programming languages like PHP, Python, and Node.js used to create dynamic content on the server.</li>

                    <li><strong>Extensions and Plugins</strong>: Additional software that enhances browser functionality, like ad blockers or developer tools.</li>
                    <li><strong>Security Features</strong>: Built-in mechanisms to protect users from malicious content, such as sandboxing and phishing protection.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h3>2. How the Web Works</h3>
                <p>The web operates on a client-server model. When a user accesses a website, their browser (client) sends a request to the server hosting the website. The server processes this request and sends back the necessary files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) to the browser, which then renders the page for the user to view and interact with.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h4>2.1 Client-Server Model</h4>
                <p>The fundamental structure of web communication, where clients (browsers) request data from servers, which respond with the necessary resources.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Requests and Responses</strong>: The exchange between client and server, typically involving HTTP methods like GET and POST.</li>
                    <li><strong>Status Codes</strong>: Numerical codes sent by the server to indicate the outcome of a request, such as 200 (OK) or 404 (Not Found).</li>
                    <li><strong>Cookies and Sessions</strong>: Mechanisms to maintain state and track user interactions across multiple requests.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>2.2 URL Structure</h4>
                <p>Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) are the addresses used to access resources on the web.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Protocol</strong>: Specifies the method of communication, typically HTTP or HTTPS.</li>
                    <li><strong>Domain Name</strong>: The human-readable address of a website, such as `example.com`.</li>
                    <li><strong>Path</strong>: The specific location of a resource within a website, following the domain name.</li>
                    <li><strong>Query Parameters</strong>: Additional data passed to the server, often used for filtering or searching.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>2.3 DNS (Domain Name System)</h4>
                <p>DNS translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses that computers use to identify each other on the network.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Domain Name Resolution</strong>: The process of converting a domain name into an IP address.</li>
                    <li><strong>DNS Records</strong>: Entries that provide information about a domain, such as A (address) records and MX (mail exchange) records.</li>
                    <li><strong>DNS Propagation</strong>: The time it takes for changes to DNS records to spread across the internet.</li>
                </ul>
