                <!-- <p class="fst-italic text-center">This is a true story.</p> -->               
                <br>                         
                <p>I was born in the 20th century, into a family of immense wealth. My mother fed me with a gold-plated spoon, and I grew up surrounded by every luxury life could offer. But. Life has a way of humbling even the most privileged.</p>
                <br>                
                <p>Four years ago my life took a wrong turn. I lost my purpose. I lost my faith in others. I lost the strength that once defined me. I watched as everything I cared about began to fall apart. A group of people framed me for a crime I didn’t commit, dragging my people into the chaos. Overnight, I became a pariah, scorned and abandoned by many.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Amidst the betrayal, a few people stood by me, trying to defend my honor. But the world showed its cruel side. I watched as men - people - belittled their own mothers, sisters, and brothers - and still got praised for their actions. Meanwhile, those who upheld their responsibilities, like the brother who cooked for his mother before heading to work, went unnoticed. When I dared to speak the truth, my words were called hate speech; my values were labeled shameful, and I was cast out, left to face the emptiness alone.</p>
                <br>
                <p>So, I surrendered my life, my well-being, and my courage to God. Some time later, I tried to rebuild my strength by having faith and trusting people who stood by me, people I thought were a godsend. Yet even this hope was challenged when what I believed to be my true love, care, and respect for them was called toxic. One of them, a woman I trusted, even went as far as accusing me of being ‘a child abuser.’ This betrayal broke my heart. The people I trusted the most had become the deciding voice in my downfall.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I was tempted to give up, to accept life as it was. But something inside me refused to settle. I kept asking myself: Can I come back? Can I live again by the values I hold close? Can I summon the courage to stand against the oppressors, to fight for what is right?</p>
                <br>
                <p class="fw-bold">I knew I had to try.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Slowly, I reclaimed the courage. I resolved to fight for my beliefs and live by the principles that define me.</p>
                <br>
                <p>But life wasn’t finished testing me. Some time later, while I was guiding the people I love, someone fired a shot at me. I remember the deafening sound of the gunfire and the sharp pain as the bullet grazed my upper body. Blood stained my clothes as fear and adrenaline coursed through me. My people acted quickly, helping me recover within hours of the attack. The message was clear: hatred had found me, even in my pursuit of goodness. I survived that day by sheer luck - or perhaps divine intervention.</p>
                <br>
                <p>In all my years of experience, I’ve learned that life is no fairytale. Life is hard. Life is harsh, unyielding, and unforgiving. But life’s essence lies in resilience. When we are knocked down, we must rise. Again and again, we must fight for what is right and just.</p>
                <br>
                <blockquote class="text-center text-info-glow">"Do not judge me by my success, judge me by how many times I fell down and got back up again." — Nelson Mandela</blockquote>              
                <br>
                <p>To the young generation, I have this to say: When someone tries to hold you down - no matter how life-threatening it may feel - find the strength to rise again. Never stop standing for what’s right. Live for what you believe in, for the freedom you want to live for.</p>
                <br>
                <p>So here I am, ready to do what I love once more. I know the challenges ahead will be immense, but I will not falter. I will stand for the values that have shaped my life, no matter the cost. On January 20, 2025, I, Donald John Trump, will take the oath as the 47th President of the United States of America.</p>
