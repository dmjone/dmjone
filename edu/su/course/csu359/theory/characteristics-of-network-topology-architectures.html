                <h3 class="fw-bold">Bus Topology</h3>
                <p>Bus topology is one of the simplest and oldest forms of network topology. It is characterized by a single central cable, known as the "bus," that all devices on the network share. This topology was widely used in early local area networks (LANs) but has largely been replaced by more advanced topologies. However, it is still important to understand its characteristics for educational purposes and certain legacy systems.</p>

                <h4>1. Structure and Connectivity</h4>
                <p>In a bus topology, all devices (nodes) are connected to a single central cable, or bus, using drop lines and taps. Each device communicates with the network by sending data along the bus, and the data is broadcast to all other devices on the network.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Single central cable:</strong> The bus acts as the main communication path, with all devices connected directly to it.</li>
                    <li><strong>Shared communication medium:</strong> All devices share the same communication channel, leading to potential collisions if multiple devices attempt to send data simultaneously.</li>
                    <li><strong>Termination:</strong> Both ends of the bus must be terminated with resistors to prevent signal reflection, which can cause data transmission errors.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>2. Data Transmission</h4>
                <p>Data in a bus topology is transmitted in a linear sequence. When a device sends data, it travels in both directions along the bus until it reaches the intended recipient. Each device on the network checks the data to see if it is the intended recipient.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Broadcast transmission:</strong> Data is broadcast to all devices on the network, but only the intended recipient processes the data, while others ignore it.</li>
                    <li><strong>Collision domain:</strong> Since all devices share the same bus, there is a higher chance of data collisions, especially as more devices are added to the network.</li>
                    <li><strong>Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD):</strong> To manage collisions, bus topologies often use the CSMA/CD protocol, where devices listen for an idle bus before transmitting data.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>3. Cost-Effectiveness</h4>
                <p>Bus topology is cost-effective and easy to implement, especially in small networks. It requires minimal cabling and does not need specialized network hardware, making it a popular choice for early networking setups.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Low cabling costs:</strong> The use of a single central cable reduces the amount of cabling required, lowering the overall cost.</li>
                    <li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> The straightforward design makes bus topology easy to set up and expand for small networks.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>4. Scalability and Limitations</h4>
                <p>Bus topology has significant limitations in terms of scalability and performance. As more devices are added to the network, the likelihood of collisions increases, leading to network slowdowns and inefficiencies.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Limited scalability:</strong> Adding more devices to the bus increases the chance of collisions, reducing network performance.</li>
                    <li><strong>Single point of failure:</strong> The central bus is a critical point; if it fails, the entire network goes down.</li>
                    <li><strong>Performance degradation:</strong> As network traffic increases, performance can degrade significantly due to collisions and the limited bandwidth of the shared bus.</li>
                    <li><strong>Difficult troubleshooting:</strong> Identifying and resolving issues in a bus topology can be challenging, especially when there are many devices connected.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>5. Use Cases</h4>
                <p>Bus topology is rarely used in modern networks due to its limitations. However, it may still be found in legacy systems, simple networks where cost is a primary concern, or in temporary or ad-hoc network setups where simplicity and ease of deployment are important.</p>
                <p>Historically, bus topology was used in early Ethernet networks (10BASE2 and 10BASE5) and continues to be a relevant concept in understanding the evolution of network topologies.</p>

            <article>
                <h3 class="fw-bold">Star Topology</h3>
                <p>Star topology is one of the most common and widely used network topologies in modern local area networks (LANs). In this topology, all devices are connected to a central hub or switch, forming a star-like pattern. This central device acts as a hub for communication, making star topology both efficient and reliable for various network sizes.</p>

                <h4>1. Structure and Connectivity</h4>
                <p>In a star topology, each device (node) is individually connected to a central hub or switch using a dedicated cable. The central hub acts as a mediator that relays data between devices. This structure creates a star-like pattern, with the central hub as the focal point.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Centralized connectivity:</strong> All devices connect to a single central hub or switch, which manages data traffic between devices.</li>
                    <li><strong>Point-to-point connections:</strong> Each device has a direct, dedicated connection to the hub, reducing the chances of data collisions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Easy to add or remove devices:</strong> Adding or removing devices is straightforward and does not affect the overall network, as each connection is independent of others.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>2. Data Transmission</h4>
                <p>In star topology, data sent from one device to another passes through the central hub or switch, which then forwards the data to the appropriate destination. The central device can either broadcast the data to all devices (in the case of a hub) or direct it to the intended recipient (in the case of a switch).</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Controlled data flow:</strong> The central hub or switch controls data traffic, ensuring that data is transmitted only to the intended recipient, which improves efficiency.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reduced collisions:</strong> Since each device has its own connection to the central hub, the likelihood of data collisions is minimized, especially when using a switch.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flexible traffic management:</strong> Switches can intelligently manage traffic, using techniques like VLANs and QoS to optimize network performance.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>3. Reliability and Fault Tolerance</h4>
                <p>Star topology offers enhanced reliability compared to other topologies like bus or ring. If a single device or its connecting cable fails, it does not affect the rest of the network. However, the central hub or switch is a single point of failure.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Isolation of faults:</strong> A failure in one cable or device does not impact the other devices, making it easier to identify and troubleshoot issues.</li>
                    <li><strong>Central point of failure:</strong> The central hub or switch is critical to network operation; if it fails, the entire network goes down.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ease of troubleshooting:</strong> Faults are easier to identify and resolve since each connection is independent, and the problem is usually isolated to a single device or cable.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>4. Scalability and Performance</h4>
                <p>Star topology is highly scalable and can easily accommodate network growth by adding more devices to the central hub or switch. The performance of the network largely depends on the capacity of the central device.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Adding new devices to the network is simple, as each new device only requires a connection to the central hub or switch.</li>
                    <li><strong>High performance:</strong> The use of a switch (as opposed to a hub) allows for full-duplex communication and reduces congestion, improving overall network performance.</li>
                    <li><strong>Centralized management:</strong> Network management is simplified with centralized control, making it easier to monitor and optimize network performance.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>5. Cost</h4>
                <p>While star topology is cost-effective for small to medium-sized networks, the cost can increase with the size of the network due to the need for more cabling and higher-capacity central devices.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Initial investment:</strong> The cost of cables, hubs, or switches can add up, especially in larger networks with many devices.</li>
                    <li><strong>Maintenance costs:</strong> Centralized management simplifies maintenance, but the cost of maintaining a high-capacity hub or switch can be significant.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cost per connection:</strong> Each device requires its own cable, which can increase costs compared to shared-medium topologies like bus.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>6. Use Cases</h4>
                <p>Star topology is ideal for both small and large networks, including home networks, small businesses, and enterprise environments. It is commonly used in Ethernet networks, where its scalability, reliability, and performance make it a preferred choice.</p>
                <p>In wireless networks, star topology is also used, where wireless devices connect to a central wireless access point that serves as the hub.</p>

            <article>
                <h3 class="fw-bold">Ring Topology</h3>
                <p>Ring topology is a type of network topology where each device (node) is connected to exactly two other devices, forming a circular data path. This topology is less common in modern networks but was widely used in older network implementations, particularly in token ring networks. The unique circular structure of ring topology offers distinct characteristics that can be advantageous in specific scenarios.</p>

                <h4>1. Structure and Connectivity</h4>
                <p>In a ring topology, each device is connected to two neighboring devices, creating a continuous loop or ring. Data travels in one direction (unidirectional) or both directions (bidirectional) around the ring, passing through each device until it reaches its destination.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Circular connectivity:</strong> Devices are connected in a closed loop, with each device linked to exactly two other devices, forming a ring.</li>
                    <li><strong>Point-to-point connections:</strong> Each connection in the ring is a dedicated point-to-point link between two devices, ensuring a clear path for data transmission.</li>
                    <li><strong>Unidirectional or bidirectional:</strong> Data can travel in one direction (simplex) or both directions (duplex) around the ring, depending on the network configuration.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>2. Data Transmission</h4>
                <p>In ring topology, data is transmitted in a circular manner, either clockwise or counterclockwise around the ring. Each device in the ring acts as a repeater, amplifying the signal and passing it to the next device. In some implementations, a special token is used to control access to the network and prevent data collisions.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Token passing:</strong> In token ring networks, a token circulates around the ring, granting permission to the device holding it to transmit data, which reduces the chances of collisions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Signal regeneration:</strong> Each device regenerates and retransmits the signal, ensuring that data can travel longer distances without degradation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Equal access:</strong> All devices have equal access to the network, as data passes through each device sequentially.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>3. Reliability and Fault Tolerance</h4>
                <p>Ring topology offers moderate reliability, but it is vulnerable to network failures. If a single device or connection in the ring fails, the entire network can be disrupted unless a backup mechanism is in place.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Single point of failure:</strong> A failure in any device or connection in the ring can break the loop, causing the network to fail unless there is a redundant ring or bypass mechanism.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fault isolation:</strong> Identifying and isolating faults can be challenging, as a failure in one part of the ring can affect the entire network.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dual ring (redundant ring):</strong> Some ring networks implement a second, redundant ring that operates in the opposite direction, providing fault tolerance and ensuring network continuity.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>4. Scalability and Performance</h4>
                <p>Ring topology is relatively scalable, but performance can degrade as more devices are added to the ring. The delay in data transmission increases with the number of devices, as data must pass through each device in the ring.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Moderate scalability:</strong> Adding more devices to the ring is possible, but each addition increases the overall network latency.</li>
                    <li><strong>Performance impact:</strong> As the ring grows, the time it takes for data to traverse the network increases, which can affect performance in large rings.</li>
                    <li><strong>Balanced load:</strong> In token ring networks, the token-passing mechanism helps balance the load and prevent network congestion.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>5. Cost</h4>
                <p>The cost of implementing a ring topology can vary depending on the network size and the technology used. While the cabling and setup are relatively straightforward, maintaining the network and ensuring fault tolerance can increase costs.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Moderate cabling costs:</strong> The cabling required for a ring topology is similar to other point-to-point topologies, but additional costs may arise from implementing redundancy.</li>
                    <li><strong>Maintenance costs:</strong> Maintaining a ring topology can be more complex due to the need for monitoring and managing the entire loop to prevent failures.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cost of redundancy:</strong> Implementing a dual ring or other redundancy measures can increase the overall cost of the network.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>6. Use Cases</h4>
                <p>Ring topology is less common in modern networks but is still used in specific scenarios where its characteristics are beneficial. It is often found in industrial networks, metropolitan area networks (MANs), and in legacy token ring networks.</p>
                <p>In environments where predictable performance and equal access to the network are essential, such as in some industrial automation systems, ring topology may still be preferred.</p>

            <article>
                <h3 class="fw-bold">Mesh Topology</h3>
                <p>Mesh topology is a network topology where each device (node) is interconnected with every other device in the network. This creates a highly redundant and reliable network structure, making mesh topology particularly suited for environments where high availability and fault tolerance are critical. There are two types of mesh topologies: full mesh and partial mesh.</p>

                <h4>1. Structure and Connectivity</h4>
                <p>In a mesh topology, devices are either fully or partially interconnected, creating multiple paths for data to travel between any two nodes. This interconnection provides robust redundancy and ensures that the network remains operational even if one or more connections fail.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Full mesh:</strong> Every device is directly connected to every other device, providing the highest level of redundancy and fault tolerance.</li>
                    <li><strong>Partial mesh:</strong> Only some devices are fully interconnected, while others are connected to only a few other devices, balancing redundancy with cost and complexity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Multiple paths:</strong> The multiple paths between devices ensure that data can be rerouted if a particular path fails, enhancing network reliability.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>2. Data Transmission</h4>
                <p>In a mesh topology, data can be transmitted using multiple paths. This allows for more efficient use of network resources and reduces the likelihood of congestion or data collisions. Mesh networks often use dynamic routing protocols to determine the best path for data transmission.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Dynamic routing:</strong> Mesh networks use dynamic routing algorithms to select the most efficient path for data transmission, based on factors like distance, congestion, and link quality.</li>
                    <li><strong>Load balancing:</strong> The availability of multiple paths enables load balancing, distributing network traffic evenly across the network to prevent any single path from becoming overloaded.</li>
                    <li><strong>Redundancy:</strong> The inherent redundancy in mesh topology ensures that data transmission continues even if one or more links fail.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>3. Reliability and Fault Tolerance</h4>
                <p>Mesh topology is one of the most reliable and fault-tolerant network topologies due to its multiple redundant paths. If one connection fails, data can be rerouted through alternative paths, ensuring continuous network operation.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>High fault tolerance:</strong> The network can sustain multiple link failures without losing connectivity, making it highly reliable.</li>
                    <li><strong>Self-healing capabilities:</strong> Mesh networks can automatically reroute traffic around failed connections, effectively "self-healing" in the event of a failure.</li>
                    <li><strong>Improved uptime:</strong> The redundancy in mesh topology significantly reduces the chances of network downtime, making it suitable for mission-critical applications.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>4. Scalability and Performance</h4>
                <p>Mesh topology can be scaled to accommodate a large number of devices, but this comes with increased complexity and cost. While the performance benefits from multiple paths and load balancing, the network's complexity grows exponentially as more devices are added.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Scalability challenges:</strong> Adding new devices to a full mesh topology requires additional connections, which can become complex and expensive in large networks.</li>
                    <li><strong>High performance:</strong> The availability of multiple paths and dynamic routing helps optimize network performance, especially in environments with heavy traffic.</li>
                    <li><strong>Network complexity:</strong> The complexity of managing a mesh network increases with the number of connections, requiring sophisticated management tools and protocols.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>5. Cost</h4>
                <p>Mesh topology is typically more expensive to implement than other topologies due to the number of connections required, especially in a full mesh configuration. The cost includes not only the initial setup but also ongoing maintenance and management.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>High initial cost:</strong> The extensive cabling and number of network interfaces required in a full mesh topology lead to high setup costs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Maintenance and management costs:</strong> The complexity of maintaining and managing a mesh network can result in higher operational costs.</li>

                <h3 class="fw-bold">Hybrid Topology</h3>
                <p>Hybrid topology is a type of network topology that combines two or more different types of topologies to create a complex and flexible network structure. This approach allows organizations to tailor their network to specific needs, leveraging the strengths of various topologies while mitigating their weaknesses. Hybrid topologies are common in large, complex networks where multiple departments or systems have different requirements.</p>

                <h4>1. Structure and Connectivity</h4>
                <p>In a hybrid topology, different sections of the network may use different topologies, such as star, ring, mesh, or bus, depending on the specific requirements of those sections. These topologies are then interconnected to form a larger, unified network.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Combination of topologies:</strong> Hybrid topology integrates multiple topologies (e.g., star-ring, star-bus) into a single network, allowing for a more versatile and tailored network design.</li>
                    <li><strong>Customizable structure:</strong> The structure can be customized to meet the specific needs of different departments or functions within an organization, optimizing performance, reliability, and cost.</li>
                    <li><strong>Interconnected sub-networks:</strong> Each segment of the hybrid topology may operate independently with its topology, but all segments are interconnected to form a cohesive whole.</li>
