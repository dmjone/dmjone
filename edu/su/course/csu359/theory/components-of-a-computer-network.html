                <h3>1. Nodes</h3>
                <p>In a computer network, a node refers to any device that can send, receive, or forward information over a communication channel. Nodes are crucial components of a network, as they enable communication between different devices. Each node has a unique address (such as an IP address) that identifies it within the network.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>1.1 Types of Nodes</h4>
                <p>Nodes can be classified based on their role in the network:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>End Devices (Host Nodes)</strong>: These are the devices at the edge of the network that send and receive data. Examples include computers, smartphones, and printers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Intermediary Devices</strong>: These nodes facilitate communication between end devices. They manage data flow and routing within the network. Examples include routers, switches, and gateways.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h5>1.1.1 End Devices (Host Nodes)</h5>
                <p>End devices serve as the source and destination of network communication. They generate and consume data. Each end device has a unique identifier, such as an IP address, and is capable of directly interacting with the user.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h5>1.1.2 Intermediary Devices</h5>
                <p>Intermediary devices are responsible for ensuring data is efficiently transferred between nodes. They route, switch, and process data to maintain smooth communication within the network. These devices do not originate or consume data but play a key role in forwarding it.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>1.2 Node Addressing</h4>
                <p>Every node in a network is identified by a unique address, such as an IP address in the case of an Internet Protocol (IP) network. Addressing enables the correct delivery of data from one node to another.</p>
                <p>In IPv4, an address is represented as a 32-bit number, typically written as four octets separated by dots (e.g., 192.168.1.1). In IPv6, the address is a 128-bit number represented in hexadecimal, separated by colons (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3::8a2e:0370:7334).</p>

                    <li><strong>Twisted Pair Cables (Ethernet)</strong>: Used in LANs, they consist of copper wires twisted to reduce interference. Example: Cat5, Cat6 cables.</li>
                    <li><strong>Coaxial Cables</strong>: Used in older networks and cable TV systems, these provide better shielding against interference than twisted pair cables.</li>
                    <li><strong>Optical Fiber Cables</strong>: Use light to transmit data, providing higher bandwidth and longer distances compared to copper cables.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h5>2.1.2 Wireless Links</h5>
                <p>Wireless links use radio frequencies, microwaves, or infrared signals to transmit data without the need for physical cables. These links allow for mobility and flexibility but are subject to interference from environmental factors. Common wireless links include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Wi-Fi</strong>: Uses radio waves to enable devices to connect to a local network or the internet.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bluetooth</strong>: Short-range wireless communication used for connecting personal devices.</li>
                    <li><strong>Satellite Links</strong>: Use microwaves to provide long-distance communication, especially in remote areas.</li>
                    <li><strong>Infrared</strong>: Used for very short-range communication (e.g., TV remotes), but limited by line-of-sight constraints.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>2.2 Link Characteristics</h4>
                <p>The performance of a link depends on several key characteristics:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Bandwidth</strong>: The amount of data that can be transmitted over a link in a given amount of time. Measured in bits per second (bps).</li>
                    <li><strong>Latency</strong>: The time taken for data to travel from the source to the destination. Lower latency means faster transmission.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reliability</strong>: The ability of the link to consistently transmit data without errors or packet loss.</li>
                    <li><strong>Noise</strong>: Unwanted interference that can disrupt data transmission, more common in wireless links.</li>
                    <li><strong>Duplex</strong>: The communication direction of a link, which can be:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Simplex</strong>: Data flows in one direction only.</li>
                            <li><strong>Half-Duplex</strong>: Data flows in both directions but not simultaneously.</li>
                            <li><strong>Full-Duplex</strong>: Data flows in both directions simultaneously.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Destination Network</strong>: The IP address range of the destination network.</li>
                    <li><strong>Next Hop</strong>: The next router or gateway to which the packet should be forwarded.</li>
                    <li><strong>Metric</strong>: A value representing the cost of using a particular route (e.g., distance or hop count).</li>
                    <li><strong>Interface</strong>: The network interface through which the packet should be sent.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>By consulting the routing table, the router makes decisions on where to forward packets to reach their destination efficiently.</p>

                <h3>5. Switches</h3>
                <p>A switch is a network device that connects multiple devices within a local area network (LAN) and uses MAC addresses to forward data frames to the correct destination. Unlike a hub, which broadcasts data to all connected devices, a switch forwards data only to the specific device it is intended for. Switches operate at the data link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model but can also function at the network layer (Layer 3) for routing purposes.</p>
            </article>

                <p>A switch uses a MAC address table to map the MAC addresses of devices to the specific ports where those devices are connected. When a switch receives a frame, it checks the destination MAC address in the table to determine where to forward the frame. If the MAC address is not found, the switch broadcasts the frame to all ports.</p>
                <p>The table is continuously updated as the switch learns new MAC addresses when devices communicate over the network.</p>

                <h4>5.4 VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network)</h4>
                <p>Managed switches support VLANs, which allow network administrators to logically segment a network into different broadcast domains. This improves security and performance by isolating traffic between different groups of devices. VLANs are configured using VLAN IDs, and devices within the same VLAN can communicate as if they were on the same physical network, even if they are connected to different switches.</p>

                <h3>6. Hubs</h3>
                <p>A hub is a basic networking device that connects multiple devices within a local area network (LAN). It operates at the physical layer (Layer 1) of the OSI model and acts as a simple data repeater, broadcasting incoming data to all connected devices. Unlike switches, hubs do not filter or direct data, leading to higher traffic and potential collisions on the network.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>6.1 Functions of a Hub</h4>
                <p>Hubs perform basic functions in a network:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Data Repeating</strong>: Hubs receive data from one port and broadcast it to all other connected devices, regardless of the intended recipient. This can lead to network inefficiencies.</li>
                    <li><strong>Signal Amplification</strong>: Hubs regenerate weak signals, allowing data to travel over longer distances without degradation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Collision Handling</strong>: Hubs do not have mechanisms to prevent data collisions, which occur when multiple devices send data simultaneously, resulting in data loss.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>6.2 Types of Hubs</h4>
                <p>Hubs are generally classified based on their functionality:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Passive Hub</strong>: A basic hub that only amplifies and broadcasts data. It does not have any built-in power source or signal regeneration capabilities.</li>
                    <li><strong>Active Hub</strong>: A hub that regenerates the signals it receives before broadcasting them. It requires a power source to boost weak signals.</li>
                    <li><strong>Intelligent Hub</strong>: A hub with basic management features like monitoring traffic and error detection. These hubs are not as advanced as switches but provide more functionality than passive and active hubs.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h5>6.2.1 Passive Hub</h5>
                <p>A passive hub simply forwards the data it receives to all devices connected to it without any amplification or regeneration. It relies entirely on the strength of the incoming signals and does not require an external power source. Passive hubs are typically used in small networks with short cable lengths.</p>

            <article>
                <h5>6.2.2 Active Hub</h5>
                <p>An active hub regenerates and amplifies the signals it receives before broadcasting them to other devices. This helps in reducing signal degradation over long distances. Active hubs require a power supply to function and are used in slightly larger networks where signal strength is a concern.</p>

                <h4>6.3 Hub Limitations</h4>
                <p>Despite being a simple and cost-effective solution for small networks, hubs have several limitations:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>No Data Filtering</strong>: Hubs broadcast all incoming data to every connected device, leading to unnecessary network traffic and inefficiency.</li>
                    <li><strong>Collisions</strong>: Since hubs operate in half-duplex mode, where devices can either send or receive data at a given time, collisions are common, especially in larger networks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Limited Network Scalability</strong>: Hubs can only support a small number of devices efficiently. For larger networks, switches are preferred due to their traffic management capabilities.</li>
                    <li><strong>Security Issues</strong>: Since hubs broadcast data to all connected devices, sensitive information can be intercepted by any device on the network, making hubs less secure compared to switches.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>6.4 Hub vs. Switch</h4>
                <p>While hubs and switches may appear similar, there are key differences in how they handle network traffic:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Data Forwarding</strong>: Hubs broadcast data to all devices, while switches intelligently forward data to specific devices based on MAC addresses.</li>
                    <li><strong>Collision Domains</strong>: Hubs create a single collision domain for all devices, meaning all devices share the same bandwidth. Switches create a separate collision domain for each port, improving performance.</li>
                    <li><strong>Efficiency</strong>: Switches are more efficient as they reduce unnecessary traffic and collisions, making them ideal for larger and more complex networks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cost</strong>: Hubs are cheaper but offer less functionality and are prone to performance issues in larger networks. Switches, though more expensive, provide better performance and security features.</li>
                </ul>
