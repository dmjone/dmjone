                <h4>6.3 Explain the Role of DNS in the Internet.</h4>
                <p><strong>DNS (Domain Name System):</strong> A system that translates human-readable domain names (e.g., <code>www.google.com</code>) into machine-readable IP addresses (e.g., <code>142.250.190.78</code>).</p>
                <p><strong>Role in the Internet:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Enables users to access websites using domain names instead of remembering complex IP addresses.</li>
                    <li>Acts as a phonebook of the internet, mapping domain names to corresponding servers.</li>
                    <li>Supports load balancing by resolving multiple IPs for a single domain.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Quality of Service (QoS):</strong> A set of technologies and policies used to prioritize certain types of network traffic to ensure optimal performance for critical applications.</p>
                <p><strong>Key Aspects:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Prioritization:</strong> Gives higher priority to latency-sensitive traffic like VoIP or video conferencing.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bandwidth Allocation:</strong> Reserves bandwidth for critical applications.</li>
                    <li><strong>Traffic Shaping:</strong> Controls data flow to avoid congestion.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> Ensuring smooth video calls even during heavy downloads.</p>
