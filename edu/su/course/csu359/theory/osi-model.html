                <p>The Data Link Layer is responsible for detecting and possibly correcting errors introduced during the transmission of frames at the Physical Layer.</p>

                <h5>3.4.1 Error Detection Techniques</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Parity Check:</strong> Adds a parity bit to each frame, allowing the receiver to determine if an error has occurred in the transmission.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC):</strong> A mathematical algorithm that creates a unique checksum for each frame. The receiver calculates its own CRC and compares it to the received CRC to detect errors.</li>

                <h5>3.4.2 Error Correction Techniques</h5>
                <p>Although error correction is primarily handled by higher layers (e.g., the Transport Layer), the Data Link Layer may use basic retransmission strategies to resend corrupted frames. This is typically done using automatic repeat request (ARQ) protocols, which request a retransmission of frames that fail the CRC check.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Stop-and-Wait:</strong> A simple flow control method where the sender sends one frame at a time and waits for an acknowledgment before sending the next frame.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sliding Window Protocol:</strong> A more efficient flow control technique where multiple frames can be sent before an acknowledgment is required, allowing for faster data transmission.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Used in Ethernet:</strong> Devices listen to the medium before transmitting data. If the medium is busy, they wait; if idle, they transmit. If a collision occurs, both devices stop and wait for a random period before retransmitting.</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>3.6.2 CSMA/CA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance)</h5>
                <ul>

                    <li><strong>Logical Addressing:</strong> The Network Layer assigns logical addresses (e.g., IP addresses) to devices, enabling them to be uniquely identified on a network. Logical addressing distinguishes between networks and hosts, making communication possible across multiple networks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Routing:</strong> Determines the optimal path for data packets to travel through the network. Routers use routing algorithms and routing tables to forward packets to their destination based on the best available path.</li>

                <p>At the Network Layer, logical addresses are used to uniquely identify devices on different networks. The most common logical addressing system is the Internet Protocol (IP), which is categorized into two versions: IPv4 and IPv6.</p>

                <h5>4.2.1 IPv4 Addressing</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>IPv4 Address Structure:</strong> An IPv4 address is a 32-bit address divided into four 8-bit octets, represented in dotted-decimal notation (e.g., 192.168.1.1).</li>
                    <li><strong>Classes:</strong> IPv4 addresses are divided into classes (A, B, C, D, E) based on the range of addresses, which dictates how many networks and hosts are available in each class.</li>
                    <li><strong>Private and Public IPs:</strong> Some IPv4 addresses are reserved for private use within local networks (e.g., 192.168.x.x, 10.x.x.x), while public IPs are routable on the internet.</li>
                    <li><strong>Subnetting:</strong> The process of dividing a larger network into smaller subnetworks. This helps in better management of IP addresses and network traffic.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Static Routing:</strong> Routes are manually configured by network administrators. This method is simple but lacks flexibility and is not suitable for large or dynamically changing networks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dynamic Routing:</strong> Routers use dynamic routing protocols to automatically discover and maintain optimal routes between devices. These protocols adjust to network changes (e.g., link failures, congestion) without manual intervention.</li>

                <h5>4.3.2 Dynamic Routing Protocols</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Distance Vector Protocols:</strong> Routers share their routing tables with neighboring routers. Examples include RIP (Routing Information Protocol) and EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol).</li>
                    <li><strong>Link-State Protocols:</strong> Routers build a complete map of the network topology by exchanging information with all routers in the network. Examples include OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) and IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate System).</li>

                <p>When a data packet exceeds the maximum transmission unit (MTU) size of the network, the Network Layer divides the packet into smaller fragments to fit within the network's constraints. These fragments are transmitted individually and reassembled by the receiving device.</p>

                <h5>4.5.1 Fragmentation Process</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Identification Field:</strong> Each fragment carries an identification field that helps the receiving device know which fragments belong to the same packet.</li>
                    <li><strong>Offset Field:</strong> Specifies the position of the fragment in the original packet, helping the receiver reassemble the data in the correct order.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flags:</strong> Indicate whether a fragment is the last one or if more fragments are expected.</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>4.5.2 Reassembly</h5>

                <h4>5.7 Reliability Mechanisms in TCP</h4>
                <p>TCP implements several mechanisms to ensure reliable data transfer.</p>

                <h5>5.7.1 Acknowledgments (ACKs)</h5>
                <p>After receiving a segment, the receiver sends an acknowledgment (ACK) back to the sender. If the sender does not receive an acknowledgment within a certain time frame, it retransmits the segment.</p>

                <h5>5.7.2 Retransmission Timeouts</h5>
                <p>TCP sets a timeout period during which it expects an acknowledgment. If the timeout expires without receiving an ACK, the segment is retransmitted. This ensures that lost or corrupted segments are resent.</p>

                <h5>5.7.3 Sliding Window Protocol</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Window Size:</strong> The window size dictates how many segments can be sent without acknowledgment. The window adjusts dynamically to account for network conditions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cumulative Acknowledgment:</strong> TCP uses cumulative acknowledgment, where a single ACK can confirm receipt of multiple segments, improving efficiency.</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>5.7.4 Congestion Control</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Slow Start:</strong> TCP begins transmission with a small congestion window and gradually increases it to probe the network's capacity without overwhelming it.</li>
                    <li><strong>Congestion Avoidance:</strong> When network congestion is detected (e.g., through packet loss), TCP reduces the transmission rate to prevent further congestion.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fast Retransmit and Fast Recovery:</strong> These mechanisms help TCP recover quickly from packet loss without waiting for a retransmission timeout.</li>

                <p>The Session Layer is the fifth layer of the OSI model, and its primary responsibility is to establish, manage, and terminate sessions between two communicating devices. A session refers to a connection or conversation between devices, such as between a client and server or between two applications. The Session Layer ensures that the session is initiated correctly, maintained during data exchange, and closed gracefully when communication is complete. It also provides mechanisms for controlling the dialog between devices and managing data flow.</p>

This ensures that any sensitive data, such as login credentials or payment information, remains secure.</p>

                <h5>7.6.2 Video Streaming</h5>
                <p>In video streaming applications, the Presentation Layer is responsible for compressing video files using formats such as H.264 or H.265 to reduce the file size, ensuring efficient transmission over the network. The receiving device then decompresses the video for playback.</p>

                <h5>7.6.3 Email Encryption (PGP/GPG)</h5>
                <p>When an email is encrypted using PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) or GPG (GNU Privacy Guard), the Presentation Layer encrypts the content of the email, ensuring that only the intended recipient, who holds the decryption key, can read it.</p>

                <h5>7.6.4 File Transfer</h5>
                <p>During file transfers, such as with FTP or SFTP, the Presentation Layer ensures that the file is properly formatted and, if necessary, compressed for transmission. It also decrypts the file at the receiving end if encryption was applied.</p>

                <p>The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model works by dividing the process of communication between two devices into seven distinct layers. Each layer is responsible for specific functions related to data transmission, ensuring smooth and efficient communication across a network. The OSI model facilitates interoperability between different systems and networks by standardizing the way data is transmitted, processed, and received.</p>

            <article class="nogenid">
                <h4>9.1 Overview of OSI Model Functionality</h4>
                <p>The OSI model defines a framework for communication in networks, where each layer performs a specific function in the process of sending and receiving data. The layers work together to break down complex network communication into manageable tasks. The communication process in the OSI model happens as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Sending Device:</strong> Data is created at the Application Layer and moves down through the layers, where it is progressively packaged, formatted, and transmitted over the network.</li>
                    <li><strong>Receiving Device:</strong> The data travels through the network and reaches the receiving device, where it moves up through the layers, being processed and eventually delivered to the application on the receiving end.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>

            <article class="nogenid">
                <h4>9.2 The Communication Process Between Devices</h4>
                <p>The OSI model follows a step-by-step process where each layer on the sending device communicates with its counterpart layer on the receiving device. The process can be divided into two phases: the data encapsulation process on the sender's side and the data de-encapsulation process on the receiver's side.</p>

                <h5>9.2.1 Data Encapsulation (Sending Device)</h5>
                <p>On the sending device, data moves from the top layer (Application Layer) to the bottom layer (Physical Layer). Each layer adds its own information (headers, trailers) to the data, which is necessary for communication. This process is called encapsulation.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Application Layer (Layer 7):</strong> The user interacts with an application (e.g., web browser or email client) to generate data.</li>
                    <li><strong>Presentation Layer (Layer 6):</strong> The data is translated into a format that the network can understand (e.g., encryption, encoding, compression).</li>
                    <li><strong>Session Layer (Layer 5):</strong> A communication session is established, and the data flow is managed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Transport Layer (Layer 4):</strong> The data is segmented into smaller units, and port numbers are added to direct the data to the correct application.</li>
                    <li><strong>Network Layer (Layer 3):</strong> Logical addressing (IP addresses) is added, determining the route the data will take across the network.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Link Layer (Layer 2):</strong> MAC addresses are added, and the data is framed for transmission. Error detection is also included at this layer.</li>
                    <li><strong>Physical Layer (Layer 1):</strong> The data is converted into electrical, optical, or radio signals and transmitted over the physical medium (cables, fiber optics, or wireless).</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>9.2.2 Data De-Encapsulation (Receiving Device)</h5>
                <p>On the receiving device, the process is reversed. The data moves from the Physical Layer to the Application Layer, and each layer removes its corresponding information, known as de-encapsulation.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Physical Layer (Layer 1):</strong> The incoming signals are received and converted back into data (bits) for further processing.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Link Layer (Layer 2):</strong> The frames are received, and error detection and MAC address information are processed. The data is passed to the Network Layer.</li>
                    <li><strong>Network Layer (Layer 3):</strong> The IP address is used to determine if the data has reached the correct device. The data is passed to the Transport Layer.</li>
                    <li><strong>Transport Layer (Layer 4):</strong> The data is reassembled from its segments, and the correct application is identified by the port number.</li>
                    <li><strong>Session Layer (Layer 5):</strong> The session information is processed, and the communication session is maintained.</li>
                    <li><strong>Presentation Layer (Layer 6):</strong> The data is translated back to its original format (e.g., decryption or decompression).</li>
                    <li><strong>Application Layer (Layer 7):</strong> The data is presented to the user or application in its original form (e.g., a web page, email, or file).</li>

                <h4>9.3 Interaction Between OSI Layers</h4>

For instance, the Transport Layer (Layer 4) interacts with the Session Layer (Layer 5) above it and the Network Layer (Layer 3) below it.

                <p>In the OSI model, horizontal communication refers to the communication that occurs between corresponding layers on two different devices (or systems) involved in a data transfer. Each layer on the sending device communicates with its peer layer on the receiving device using a predefined protocol. Horizontal communication is essential for ensuring that data moves smoothly between the sender and the receiver, maintaining the integrity and structure of the communication at each layer.</p>
            </article>

            <article class="nogenid">
                <h4>10.1 How Horizontal Communication Works</h4>
                <p>Horizontal communication takes place when a protocol operating at a particular layer of the OSI model on the sending device exchanges data with the corresponding layer on the receiving device. This communication relies on standardized protocols, which ensure that the two layers can understand each other, even if they are implemented differently on each system.</p>

                <p>Here’s how horizontal communication works for each layer:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Layer 7 - Application Layer:</strong> At the Application Layer, horizontal communication involves the transmission of application-specific data. For example, when a web browser (HTTP client) requests a web page from a web server (HTTP server), both devices use the HTTP protocol for this exchange.</li>
                    <li><strong>Layer 6 - Presentation Layer:</strong> The Presentation Layer ensures that data is formatted correctly for both systems. For example, when one system uses ASCII encoding and another uses Unicode, horizontal communication at this layer translates the data between these formats.</li>
                    <li><strong>Layer 5 - Session Layer:</strong> At the Session Layer, horizontal communication ensures the session is maintained. If one system needs to pause communication, this information is relayed to the other system to ensure that the session remains synchronized.</li>
                    <li><strong>Layer 4 - Transport Layer:</strong> The Transport Layer ensures reliable data transfer between systems. For example, TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) handles segmentation, sequencing, and acknowledgments between devices, ensuring that both systems agree on the data being exchanged.</li>
                    <li><strong>Layer 3 - Network Layer:</strong> At the Network Layer, horizontal communication involves logical addressing (IP addresses) and routing. Devices exchange data to determine the best path for the data to travel through the network, using protocols like IP (Internet Protocol).</li>
                    <li><strong>Layer 2 - Data Link Layer:</strong> Horizontal communication at this layer involves MAC addressing and framing. Two devices on the same network segment use protocols like Ethernet to frame data and verify data integrity before passing it up to higher layers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Layer 1 - Physical Layer:</strong> At the Physical Layer, horizontal communication refers to the actual transmission of raw bits over the physical medium (cables, fiber optics, or wireless signals). The physical properties of the medium (e.g., voltage levels, light pulses) ensure that bits are transmitted from one device to another.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>10.2 Encapsulation and Horizontal Communication</h4>
                <p>Horizontal communication is part of the encapsulation process. As data passes down the OSI layers on the sender’s side, each layer adds its own protocol-specific headers and trailers. These headers and trailers are intended for the corresponding layer on the receiver’s side, forming the basis of horizontal communication.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Application to Application:</strong> The Application Layer data from the sender is read by the Application Layer of the receiver.</li>
                    <li><strong>Transport to Transport:</strong> TCP or UDP segments created by the sender are understood and processed by the receiver's Transport Layer.</li>
                    <li><strong>Network to Network:</strong> IP packets generated by the sender are routed and delivered to the correct IP address by the Network Layer of the receiving system.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>When the data reaches the receiving device, each layer removes its corresponding header (a process known as de-encapsulation) and passes the data to the next layer above until it reaches the Application Layer.</p>

                <p>Vertical communication in the OSI model refers to the communication between adjacent layers on a single device, as data moves up or down the OSI stack. This type of communication ensures that each layer passes data to the next layer, either preparing it for transmission (on the sender’s side) or for processing (on the receiver’s side). Vertical communication is essential for the encapsulation (sending) and de-encapsulation (receiving) processes, allowing each layer to perform its specific functions before handing off the data to the next layer.</p>
            </article>

            <article class="nogenid">
                <h4>11.1 How Vertical Communication Works</h4>
                <p>Vertical communication happens when data passes through each layer of the OSI model, either from the Application Layer (Layer 7) to the Physical Layer (Layer 1) on the sending device or from the Physical Layer back up to the Application Layer on the receiving device.</p>

                <h5>11.1.1 Data Encapsulation (Vertical Communication on the Sender’s Side)</h5>
                <p>On the sender’s side, data generated at the Application Layer moves down through each layer, with each layer adding its specific protocol headers (and sometimes trailers) to the data. This process is known as encapsulation.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Application Layer (Layer 7):</strong> The data originates from an application (e.g., sending an email or requesting a webpage).</li>
                    <li><strong>Presentation Layer (Layer 6):</strong> The data is formatted, encrypted, or compressed for transmission.</li>
                    <li><strong>Session Layer (Layer 5):</strong> A session is established to manage the communication between two devices.</li>
                    <li><strong>Transport Layer (Layer 4):</strong> The data is segmented into smaller units, and protocols like TCP or UDP ensure reliable delivery.</li>
                    <li><strong>Network Layer (Layer 3):</strong> Logical addressing (e.g., IP addresses) is added to route the data across the network.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Link Layer (Layer 2):</strong> The data is framed, and MAC addresses are added to allow devices on the same network to identify each other.</li>
                    <li><strong>Physical Layer (Layer 1):</strong> The raw data (bits) is converted into electrical, optical, or radio signals and transmitted over the physical medium.</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>11.1.2 Data De-Encapsulation (Vertical Communication on the Receiver’s Side)</h5>
                <p>On the receiving side, the data travels upward through the OSI layers. Each layer removes its corresponding header (de-encapsulation) and processes the information before passing it to the next layer until it reaches the application.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Physical Layer (Layer 1):</strong> The signals are received and converted back into a bitstream.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Link Layer (Layer 2):</strong> The bitstream is framed, error-checked, and the MAC addresses are verified before passing the data to the Network Layer.</li>
                    <li><strong>Network Layer (Layer 3):</strong> The IP address is checked to confirm the data has reached the correct device, and the packet is passed to the Transport Layer.</li>
                    <li><strong>Transport Layer (Layer 4):</strong> The data segments are reassembled, and TCP or UDP ensures that all segments are received in the correct order before passing the data to the Session Layer.</li>
                    <li><strong>Session Layer (Layer 5):</strong> The session information is processed, maintaining synchronization between devices.</li>
                    <li><strong>Presentation Layer (Layer 6):</strong> The data is decrypted, decompressed, and formatted into a readable form.</li>

This modular approach ensures that each layer handles its part of the data processing, and the communication remains standardized across devices and networks.</p>

                <h5>11.2.1 Encapsulation Process</h5>
                <ul>

                </ul>
            </article>

            <article class="nogenid">
                <h4>15.7 Step 7: Export Data</h4>
                <p>If you need to share or further analyze specific packets, Wireshark allows you to export captured data in various formats.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Save Packet Capture:</strong> Save the full packet capture by going to <code>File > Save As</code> and selecting the .pcap format.</li>
                    <li><strong>Export Objects:</strong> For protocols like HTTP, you can export objects (e.g., files downloaded from a website) by selecting <code>File > Export Objects</code> and choosing the relevant protocol.</li>
                    <li><strong>Export Selected Packets:</strong> Select specific packets to save by highlighting them in the Packet List pane and choosing <code>File > Export Selected Packets</code>.</li>
                </ul>

            <article class="nogenid">
                <h4>15.8 Step 8: Analyze and Troubleshoot</h4>
                <p>Now that you have captured and filtered network traffic, you can use Wireshark to identify issues such as:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Latency:</strong> Check the round-trip time (RTT) for TCP connections to identify high latency in network communication.</li>
                    <li><strong>Packet Loss:</strong> Look for missing sequence numbers in TCP streams, which can indicate packet loss or dropped connections.</li>
                    <li><strong>Network Misconfigurations:</strong> Identify issues like incorrect IP addressing, routing errors, or DNS misconfigurations by analyzing the captured packets.</li>
                    <li><strong>Security Threats:</strong> Detect suspicious traffic, such as unusual IP addresses, port scans, or malformed packets, which may indicate a security breach or attack.</li>
                </ul>
