                <h3>1. WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network)</h3>
                <p>A WLAN, or Wireless Local Area Network, is a type of local network that allows devices to connect and communicate wirelessly within a defined area. Unlike traditional LANs, which require physical cables, WLANs use radio waves to transmit data, enabling mobility and flexibility for devices such as smartphones, laptops, and IoT devices. WLANs are commonly used in homes, offices, schools, and public spaces to provide internet access without the need for wired connections.</p>

                <article>
                    <h4>1.1 Key Components of WLAN</h4>
                    <p>WLANs rely on several components to function effectively:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Access Point (AP)</strong>: Acts as a bridge between wireless devices and the wired network. It transmits and receives data over radio waves.</li>
                        <li><strong>Wireless Clients</strong>: Devices such as smartphones, laptops, and tablets that connect to the network using wireless signals.</li>
                        <li><strong>SSID (Service Set Identifier)</strong>: The name of the wireless network that devices connect to.</li>
                        <li><strong>Wireless Medium</strong>: The airwaves over which data is transmitted using radio frequencies (commonly 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz bands).</li>
                    </ul>
                </article>

                <h3>2. WPA2 PSK (Wi-Fi Protected Access 2 - Pre-Shared Key)</h3>
                <p>WPA2 PSK is a widely-used security protocol for securing WLANs. It provides strong encryption for wireless communication and is typically used in home and small business networks. WPA2 with PSK ensures that only users who know the pre-shared key (password) can access the network.</p>

                <article>
                    <h4>2.1 How WPA2 PSK Works</h4>
                    <p>WPA2 PSK employs a passphrase or key to encrypt and decrypt data over a wireless network. Here’s how it works:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Key Generation</strong>: The pre-shared key is generated from a passphrase entered during the configuration of the WLAN.</li>
                        <li><strong>Data Encryption</strong>: WPA2 PSK uses the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) to secure data transmitted between devices and the access point.</li>
                        <li><strong>Mutual Authentication</strong>: Devices on the network must provide the correct PSK to connect. This ensures that both the access point and client are authenticated.</li>
                    </ul>
                </article>

                <article>
                    <h4>2.2 Features of WPA2 PSK</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Encryption Strength</strong>: WPA2 uses AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), which is highly secure and resistant to modern attacks.</li>
                        <li><strong>Pre-Shared Key (PSK)</strong>: The network is secured using a password or key shared between the access point and connected devices.</li>
                        <li><strong>Simplicity</strong>: Easy to configure in home and small business environments without the need for an authentication server (like WPA2 Enterprise).</li>
                    </ul>
                </article>

                <article>
                    <h4>2.3 Advantages of WPA2 PSK</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>High Security</strong>: WPA2 PSK provides strong encryption, ensuring that only authorized users with the correct PSK can access the network.</li>
                        <li><strong>Compatibility</strong>: Supported by most modern wireless devices, making it the default choice for many home networks.</li>
                        <li><strong>Easy to Set Up</strong>: Requires minimal configuration; users only need to input the correct PSK to join the network.</li>
                    </ul>

                <h3>3. Configure and Verify WLAN within the GUI using WPA2 PSK</h3>
                <p>WPA2 (Wi-Fi Protected Access 2) with PSK (Pre-Shared Key) is one of the most secure methods to protect a wireless network. This section focuses on configuring and verifying a Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) using WPA2 PSK within a Graphical User Interface (GUI).</p>

                <article>
                    <h4>3.1 Configuring WLAN with WPA2 PSK</h4>
                    <p>To secure a WLAN using WPA2 PSK, the configuration process involves setting up an SSID (Service Set Identifier), selecting the security mode (WPA2), and entering a PSK (pre-shared key). Follow these steps to configure the WLAN:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Step 1: Access Router/Access Point GUI</strong><br>
                            Open a browser and enter the default gateway IP (usually <code>192.168.1.1</code> or <code>192.168.0.1</code>) to access the router’s web interface. Log in with the admin credentials.</li>

                        <li><strong>Step 2: Navigate to Wireless Settings</strong><br>
                            Once inside the router GUI, locate the "Wireless" section. This might vary depending on the router model but is usually labeled as 'Wireless Settings' or 'Wi-Fi Configuration'.</li>

                        <li><strong>Step 3: Set the SSID</strong><br>
                            Enter a unique SSID to identify your WLAN. This is the name that will appear on devices trying to connect to the network.</li>

                        <li><strong>Step 4: Choose WPA2 PSK</strong><br>
                            Under the security settings, select WPA2 PSK (sometimes labeled as WPA2 Personal) as the security mode. Ensure that WPA2 is chosen over WPA for stronger encryption.</li>

                        <li><strong>Step 5: Enter Pre-Shared Key (PSK)</strong><br>
                            Create a strong passphrase for the pre-shared key (at least 8 characters). The PSK will be required by devices attempting to connect to the WLAN.</li>

                        <li><strong>Step 6: Save Settings</strong><br>
                            After setting the SSID and WPA2 PSK, save the changes. The router will apply the configurations, which may cause a brief disconnection of devices from the network.</li>
                    </ul>
                </article>

                <article>
                    <h4>3.2 Verifying WLAN Configuration</h4>
                    <p>After configuring the WLAN, it's important to verify that the network is secure and operational. This can be done by checking both network connectivity and encryption settings.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Step 1: Connect a Device</strong><br>
                            Using a wireless device (e.g., laptop, smartphone), locate the SSID you configured. Select it and enter the PSK to establish a connection.</li>

                        <li><strong>Step 2: Verify Network Security</strong><br>
                            After successfully connecting, verify the encryption by accessing the network settings on the connected device. Ensure the connection is using WPA2 encryption.</li>

                        <li><strong>Step 3: Verify Internet Access</strong><br>
                            Once connected to the WLAN, test the internet connection by opening a website or running a speed test to ensure full functionality.</li>
                    </ul>
                </article>

                <article>
                    <h4>3.3 Additional Security Considerations</h4>
                    <p>To enhance security, you may consider the following:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Change the default admin credentials</strong> of the router to prevent unauthorized access.</li>
                        <li><strong>Enable MAC address filtering</strong> to restrict which devices can connect to the WLAN.</li>
                        <li><strong>Disable SSID broadcast</strong> to hide the network from casual users (though this is not a foolproof security measure).</li>
                    </ul>
