                <h3>0. Network Topology</h3>
                <p>Network topology refers to the arrangement and physical or logical layout of the devices and cables in a network. It dictates how data flows across the network and significantly impacts its performance, scalability, fault tolerance, and overall efficiency. The two primary classifications of network topology are:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Physical Topology:</strong> Describes the actual physical layout of the network devices, cables, and connections.</li>
                    <li><strong>Logical Topology:</strong> Refers to how data flows within the network, regardless of its physical design.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>When designing or evaluating network topologies, key factors such as cost, performance, scalability, fault tolerance, and ease of installation and maintenance are considered. Choosing the right topology is essential for optimizing network performance and reliability.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h4>0.1 Importance of Network Topology</h4>
                <p>Network topology plays a critical role in determining:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Efficiency of Data Transmission:</strong> The arrangement of devices and connections affects how quickly and reliably data is transmitted across the network.</li>
                    <li><strong>Network Fault Tolerance:</strong> Certain topologies, like mesh, offer high redundancy, allowing networks to remain functional even if some connections fail.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cost of Deployment:</strong> Topologies like star and mesh can require more cabling and infrastructure, impacting setup and maintenance costs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Some topologies allow easier network expansion compared to others, making them more suitable for growing networks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Troubleshooting and Maintenance:</strong> Different topologies have varying levels of complexity when diagnosing issues, which can affect network downtime and repair time.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h4>0.2 Common Types of Network Topologies</h4>
                <p>Several common topologies are used in network design, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. These include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Bus Topology</li>
                    <li>Star Topology</li>
                    <li>Ring Topology</li>
                    <li>Mesh Topology</li>
                    <li>Hybrid Topology</li>
                    <li>Tree Topology</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Each topology is suitable for specific network sizes, configurations, and use cases, based on its inherent properties. Choosing the correct topology is crucial for ensuring that a network meets its operational and performance requirements.</p>

                <h4>1.1 Bus Topology</h4>
                <p>A Bus Topology is a type of network topology in which all devices (nodes) are connected to a single communication line, called a bus. This communication line, or backbone, carries data signals to all nodes.</p>


                <h5>1.1.1 Characteristics of Bus Topology</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Single Backbone:</strong> All devices share a single communication medium, typically a coaxial cable or Ethernet cable.</li>
                    <li><strong>Broadcast Nature:</strong> Data is broadcast to all devices on the network, and only the intended recipient processes it, while others ignore it.</li>
                    <li><strong>Terminators:</strong> At both ends of the bus, terminators are used to absorb signals and prevent reflection, which can cause signal interference.</li>
                </ul>


                <h5>1.1.2 Data Transmission in Bus Topology</h5>
                <p>Data is transmitted as packets over the bus. Each packet contains the address of the destination device. Every node checks the address, but only the node with the matching address accepts the data.</p>
                <p>Since all devices share the bus, only one device can send data at a time. Collisions (when two devices send data simultaneously) are managed using methods like Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD).</p>


                <h5>1.1.3 Advantages of Bus Topology</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Cost-Effective:</strong> Minimal cabling is required compared to other topologies, making it economical for small networks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Easy to Implement:</strong> Bus topology is simple to install and does not require advanced configurations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Additional devices can be added without much impact on the existing network structure.</li>
                </ul>


                <h5>1.1.4 Disadvantages of Bus Topology</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Collision Prone:</strong> Multiple devices sharing the same communication line can lead to data collisions, resulting in delays and network slowdowns.</li>
                    <li><strong>Limited Size:</strong> Bus topology is not suitable for large networks because the signal degrades as it travels over long distances.</li>
                    <li><strong>Single Point of Failure:</strong> If the backbone cable fails, the entire network goes down, making it less reliable than other topologies.</li>
                </ul>


                <h5>1.1.5 Use Cases of Bus Topology</h5>
                <p>Bus topology was historically used in small Local Area Networks (LANs) and early Ethernet networks. However, due to its limitations, it is less common in modern networks, which now prefer topologies like star or mesh for better fault tolerance and performance.</p>

                <h3>2. Star Topology</h3>
                <p>Star topology is a network setup where all devices (nodes) are connected to a central hub or switch. Each node has its own dedicated connection to the central device, which manages the network's data flow.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h4>2.1 Characteristics of Star Topology</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Central Hub:</strong> The central hub or switch acts as a mediator, controlling all communications between nodes. Each device is connected directly to the hub.</li>
                    <li><strong>Point-to-Point Connection:</strong> Every node has a point-to-point connection with the central device, ensuring that data is transferred directly between the device and the hub.</li>
                    <li><strong>No Direct Node-to-Node Connection:</strong> Nodes are not directly connected to each other. All communication passes through the central hub.</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>2.1.1 Data Transmission in Star Topology</h5>
                <p>Data from a device is sent to the central hub or switch, which then forwards it to the destination device. If the hub is a switch, it intelligently forwards the data only to the intended recipient, while a hub broadcasts data to all connected devices, though only the intended recipient processes it.</p>

                <h5>2.1.2 Advantages of Star Topology</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Fault Isolation:</strong> If one node or its connection fails, the rest of the network continues to function normally. Only the faulty connection is affected.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ease of Troubleshooting:</strong> Problems can be easily identified and fixed due to the centralization of the connections.</li>
                    <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Adding or removing devices is straightforward as it only involves connecting or disconnecting from the hub.</li>
                    <li><strong>Improved Performance:</strong> Since each node has its own dedicated connection, data collisions are minimized, unlike in bus topology.</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>2.1.3 Disadvantages of Star Topology</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Single Point of Failure:</strong> The central hub or switch is a single point of failure. If it fails, the entire network becomes inoperable.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cost:</strong> Requires more cabling than bus topology because each device must have a direct connection to the central hub.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dependency on Central Hub:</strong> The performance and reliability of the network are dependent on the capabilities of the central hub. A malfunction or overload on the hub can impact the entire network.</li>
                </ul>


                <h5>2.1.4 Use Cases of Star Topology</h5>
                <p>Star topology is widely used in modern Local Area Networks (LANs) due to its fault tolerance and scalability. It is common in home and office networks where central switches or routers control traffic between devices. Ethernet networks often employ a star topology using switches as the central device.</p>

                <h3>3. Ring Topology</h3>
                <p>In a Ring Topology, each device is connected to two other devices, forming a closed loop. Data travels in one direction (unidirectional) or both directions (bidirectional) around the ring, passing through each node until it reaches its destination.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h4>3.1 Characteristics of Ring Topology</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Closed Loop:</strong> Devices are connected in a circular structure where each device has exactly two neighboring devices.</li>
                    <li><strong>Token Passing:</strong> In many ring topologies, a token-based protocol is used to control access to the network, where a device can send data only when it holds a special data packet called a "token."</li>
                    <li><strong>Directional Flow:</strong> Data flows either clockwise (unidirectional) or both clockwise and counterclockwise (bidirectional) in the ring, depending on the configuration.</li>
                </ul>
                <h5>3.1.1 Data Transmission in Ring Topology</h5>
                <p>Data travels through each node in the ring. Each device checks the data packet’s address and passes it along if it is not the intended recipient. In a unidirectional ring, data travels in one direction, but in a bidirectional ring, data can travel both ways, which improves fault tolerance.</p>

                <h5>3.1.2 Advantages of Ring Topology</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Orderly Data Transmission:</strong> The token-passing protocol ensures that only one device transmits data at a time, minimizing the risk of collisions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Equal Access:</strong> Each device has equal access to the network, and no device can monopolize the communication channel.</li>
                    <li><strong>Predictable Performance:</strong> Performance is predictable because data travels in an orderly manner along the ring, unlike in star or bus topologies.</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>3.1.3 Disadvantages of Ring Topology</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Single Point of Failure:</strong> A failure in any single device or connection can break the entire network unless a redundant ring is used (bidirectional).</li>
                    <li><strong>Latency:</strong> As data passes through multiple devices before reaching the destination, the time it takes to deliver a message increases with the number of devices in the ring.</li>
                    <li><strong>Difficult Troubleshooting:</strong> Identifying and fixing faults can be challenging, as a break in the ring disrupts the entire network.</li>
                </ul>
                <h5>3.1.4 Use Cases of Ring Topology</h5>
                <p>Ring topology was commonly used in older networks like Token Ring, developed by IBM. It is less popular today due to the complexity and limitations of single-point failure. However, variations of the ring topology are still used in specific scenarios like Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) networks, which use a dual-ring structure for fault tolerance.</p>

                <h3>4. Mesh Topology</h3>
                <p>In Mesh Topology, each device (node) is connected to every other device in the network, either directly or indirectly. This creates multiple paths for data to travel, providing high fault tolerance and reliability.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h4>4.1 Characteristics of Mesh Topology</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Full and Partial Mesh:</strong> In a full mesh, every device is directly connected to every other device. In a partial mesh, some devices are connected to multiple devices, but not all.</li>
                    <li><strong>Redundant Paths:</strong> Mesh topology provides multiple paths between any two devices, ensuring that even if one path fails, data can still travel through alternate routes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Decentralized Structure:</strong> There is no central controlling device, as communication occurs directly between nodes. This decentralization increases network robustness.</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>4.1.1 Data Transmission in Mesh Topology</h5>
                <p>Data can travel through multiple paths in a mesh network. The network uses routing protocols to determine the best path based on factors like distance or network congestion. If one path fails, data can be rerouted through alternative paths, ensuring delivery without disruption.</p>

                <h5>4.1.2 Advantages of Mesh Topology</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Fault Tolerance:</strong> Since multiple paths exist between devices, the network remains operational even if a connection fails.</li>
                    <li><strong>High Reliability:</strong> The redundancy of connections ensures that data can always find a path to its destination, reducing downtime and improving reliability.</li>
                    <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Adding new devices does not significantly affect the performance of the network, as multiple paths already exist.</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>4.1.3 Disadvantages of Mesh Topology</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>High Cost:</strong> The need for many cables and connections increases the cost, especially in a full mesh network where every device must be connected to every other device.</li>
                    <li><strong>Complex Setup and Maintenance:</strong> Managing and configuring a large number of connections can be challenging, requiring advanced network management skills.</li>
                    <li><strong>Redundant Connections:</strong> Some connections might not be used regularly, leading to wasted resources in certain scenarios.</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>4.1.4 Use Cases of Mesh Topology</h5>
                <p>Mesh topology is commonly used in mission-critical networks where reliability and fault tolerance are crucial. Examples include wireless mesh networks, military communication networks, and networks that require constant uptime and minimal failure risk, such as in data centers or industrial control systems.</p>

                <h3>5. Hybrid Topology</h3>
                <p>Hybrid Topology is a network configuration that combines two or more different types of topologies, such as star, bus, ring, or mesh, to form a complex network structure. By combining multiple topologies, hybrid networks can leverage the advantages of each while mitigating their individual weaknesses.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h4>5.1 Characteristics of Hybrid Topology</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Combination of Topologies:</strong> A hybrid network is created by integrating different topologies (e.g., a star-bus hybrid may connect multiple star networks via a bus backbone).</li>
                    <li><strong>Customizable Structure:</strong> Hybrid topologies are flexible and can be tailored to specific needs, allowing for a mix of the best properties from different topologies.</li>
                    <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> The network can be scaled by adding new topologies without affecting the overall performance, making it ideal for large organizations.</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>5.1.1 Data Transmission in Hybrid Topology</h5>
                <p>Data transmission in a hybrid topology depends on the specific combination of topologies used. For instance, in a star-ring hybrid, data within each star segment is managed by the central hub, and communication between different segments follows the ring protocol.</p>
                <p>Routing and data flow in hybrid networks are managed based on the design of each topology type, with the hybrid configuration ensuring optimized performance and fault tolerance.</p>

                <h5>5.1.2 Advantages of Hybrid Topology</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Hybrid topology allows for a highly flexible network design that can be customized to meet the specific needs of an organization.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reliable and Scalable:</strong> By integrating various topologies, the hybrid network can be made more reliable, scalable, and adaptable to changes in network size or traffic.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fault Tolerance:</strong> The use of multiple topologies ensures that failures in one part of the network can be isolated without affecting the entire system.</li>
                    <li><strong>Efficient Performance:</strong> Hybrid topology can be optimized for performance by selecting the appropriate topology for each segment, ensuring efficient data flow.</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>5.1.3 Disadvantages of Hybrid Topology</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Complex Setup:</strong> Designing and implementing a hybrid topology can be complex due to the need to integrate multiple topology types.</li>
                    <li><strong>High Cost:</strong> The complexity of the network structure may require more cabling, hardware, and specialized equipment, making it more expensive to install and maintain.</li>
                    <li><strong>Maintenance Challenges:</strong> Managing and troubleshooting a hybrid network can be difficult, especially in large setups with multiple integrated topologies.</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>5.1.4 Use Cases of Hybrid Topology</h5>
                <p>Hybrid topology is commonly used in large organizations where different departments or segments have unique networking needs. For example, a university campus network may use a combination of star topology in individual buildings (for ease of troubleshooting) connected by a backbone bus topology. Hybrid networks are also ideal for corporate offices, industrial setups, and data centers, where flexibility and fault tolerance are key.</p>

                <h3>6. Tree Topology</h3>
                <p>Tree Topology, also known as hierarchical topology, is a structure in which groups of star-configured networks are connected to a central bus backbone. This topology resembles a tree structure, where each branch represents a network segment.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h4>6.1 Characteristics of Tree Topology</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Hierarchical Structure:</strong> The topology is organized in a hierarchical manner, where lower-level nodes are connected to higher-level nodes in a parent-child relationship.</li>
                    <li><strong>Combination of Star and Bus:</strong> Tree topology combines elements of both star and bus topologies. Each group of devices forms a star around a central hub, and the hubs are connected using a bus backbone.</li>
                    <li><strong>Root Node:</strong> The top-level node is often referred to as the root, and from there, the network branches out into smaller sub-networks.</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>6.1.1 Data Transmission in Tree Topology</h5>
                <p>Data is transmitted from one node to another through the hierarchy of the tree. At each level, the central hub controls the communication within its group of nodes. If data needs to be transmitted to another group, it is sent up the hierarchy to the root node, which then forwards the data to the correct destination branch.</p>

                <h5>6.1.2 Advantages of Tree Topology</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Tree topology supports easy network expansion by adding more branches, making it suitable for large networks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hierarchical Management:</strong> The hierarchical nature allows for easier management and troubleshooting at different levels of the network.</li>
                    <li><strong>Segmentation:</strong> Individual segments can be isolated from the rest of the network in case of a failure, preventing widespread disruption.</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>6.1.3 Disadvantages of Tree Topology</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Single Point of Failure (Backbone):</strong> The backbone bus is a single point of failure. If it fails, the entire network may go down.</li>
                    <li><strong>Complexity:</strong> Tree topology can become complicated to design, manage, and maintain, especially as the network grows.</li>
                    <li><strong>High Cabling Requirements:</strong> Due to its hierarchical structure, more cabling is required compared to simpler topologies, increasing costs.</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>6.1.4 Use Cases of Tree Topology</h5>
                <p>Tree topology is commonly used in large networks, such as enterprise-level LANs or university campus networks, where a hierarchical structure helps in managing different segments. It is also useful in network systems that require scalability and segment isolation, such as departmental networks connected to a larger organizational network.</p>
