                <h3>1. IPv4 Addressing</h3>
                <p>IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4) is the fourth version of the Internet Protocol and is widely used to identify devices on a network using a numerical address. Each IPv4 address is a 32-bit number that uniquely identifies a device on the network. The address is typically written in decimal format, divided into four octets (8 bits each), separated by dots (e.g., 192.168.1.1).</p>

                <h4>1.1 Structure of an IPv4 Address</h4>
                <p>An IPv4 address is composed of two main parts: the Network ID and the Host ID. These parts help in determining the device's location within a network and identifying the specific device on that network.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Network ID</strong>: The portion of the address that identifies the specific network the device belongs to.</li>
                    <li><strong>Host ID</strong>: The portion of the address that identifies the specific device (host) within the network.</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>1.1.1 Example of IPv4 Address Structure</h5>
                <p>Consider the IPv4 address <code>192.168.1.1</code>:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>192.168.1</strong>: Network ID</li>
                    <li><strong>.1</strong>: Host ID</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>1.2 IPv4 Address Classes</h4>
                <p>IPv4 addresses are divided into five classes (A, B, C, D, E) based on the first few bits of the address. This classification helps in determining the size of the network and the number of devices it can support.</p>


                <article>

                <h4>1.3 Subnetting in IPv4</h4>
                <p>Subnetting is a technique used to divide a larger network into smaller, more manageable subnetworks (subnets). This is achieved by borrowing bits from the Host ID to create a Subnet ID.</p>

                <article>
                    <h5>1.3.1 Subnet Mask</h5>
                    <p>A subnet mask is a 32-bit number that masks the IP address to distinguish the network portion from the host portion. The subnet mask consists of a series of 1s followed by a series of 0s. The 1s represent the network portion, while the 0s represent the host portion.</p>

                    <p>For example, for the address <code>192.168.1.1</code> with a subnet mask <code>255.255.255.0</code>:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Network ID</strong>: 192.168.1 (represented by the first 24 bits)</li>
                        <li><strong>Host ID</strong>: .1 (represented by the remaining 8 bits)</li>
                    </ul>
                </article>

                <article>
                    <h5>1.3.2 CIDR Notation</h5>
                    <p>Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation is a method for specifying IP addresses and their associated routing prefix. The format is <code>a.b.c.d/n</code>, where <code>n</code> represents the number of bits in the subnet mask.</p>

                    <p>For example, <code>192.168.1.1/24</code> indicates that the first 24 bits are the network portion, leaving 8 bits for hosts.</p>

                <h4>1.4 Special IPv4 Addresses</h4>
                <p>Certain IPv4 addresses have special purposes:</p>

                <article>
                    <h5>1.4.1 Private IP Addresses</h5>
                    <p>These addresses are used within private networks and are not routable on the public internet. Examples include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Class A</strong>: 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255</li>
                        <li><strong>Class B</strong>: 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255</li>
                        <li><strong>Class C</strong>: 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255</li>
                    </ul>
                </article>

                <article>
                    <h5>1.4.2 Loopback Addresses</h5>
                    <p>The address range <code>127.0.0.0</code> to <code>127.255.255.255</code> is reserved for loopback addresses, which are used to test network software on the local machine.</p>

                <h4>1.5 Limitations of IPv4</h4>
                <p>IPv4, while widely used, has limitations:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Address Exhaustion</strong>: IPv4 provides around 4.3 billion unique addresses, which is insufficient given the growth of the internet.</li>
                    <li><strong>Security</strong>: IPv4 was not designed with security in mind, making it vulnerable to attacks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Configuration Complexity</strong>: Configuring large networks can be cumbersome due to the lack of built-in support for automatic configuration.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2. Subnetting</h3>
                <p>Subnetting is a process in IPv4 addressing that divides a larger network into smaller, more manageable subnetworks, or subnets. This is particularly useful for improving network organization, security, and efficiency. Subnetting allows networks to be segmented into multiple smaller networks, each with its own distinct range of IP addresses, helping optimize address allocation and reduce broadcast traffic.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>2.1 Purpose of Subnetting</h4>
                <p>The primary reasons for subnetting a network include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Efficient IP Address Allocation</strong>: Subnetting allows for the optimal use of available IP addresses by dividing a large network into smaller networks that match the specific needs of an organization.</li>
                    <li><strong>Improved Network Performance</strong>: By reducing the size of broadcast domains, subnetting decreases the amount of broadcast traffic, which can improve overall network performance.</li>
                    <li><strong>Enhanced Security</strong>: Subnetting can isolate different parts of a network, improving security by limiting the spread of broadcast traffic and providing better control over network access.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>

                <h4>2.2 Subnet Masks</h4>
                <p>A subnet mask is a 32-bit number that separates the network portion of an IP address from the host portion. It is used in conjunction with an IP address to identify the specific subnet to which the IP address belongs.</p>

                <p>The subnet mask consists of a series of consecutive 1s followed by 0s. The 1s indicate the network portion of the address, and the 0s indicate the host portion.</p>

                <p>Example:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>IP Address: <code>192.168.10.0</code></li>
                    <li>Subnet Mask: <code>255.255.255.0</code> (equivalent to <code>/24</code> in CIDR notation)</li>
                    <li>Network Portion: <code>192.168.10</code></li>
                    <li>Host Portion: <code>.0</code></li>
                </ul>

                <h4>2.3 Calculating Subnets</h4>
                <p>To calculate the number of possible subnets and hosts per subnet, you need to consider the number of bits borrowed from the host portion to create the subnet.</p>

                <article>
                    <h5>2.3.1 Number of Subnets</h5>
                    <p>The number of subnets created is determined by the formula:</p>

                    <p>$$\text{Number of Subnets} = 2^n$$</p>
                    <p>where <code>n</code> is the number of bits borrowed from the host portion.</p>

                    <p>Example: If 3 bits are borrowed, the number of subnets is:</p>
                    <p>$$2^3 = 8 \text{ subnets}$$</p>
                </article>

                <article>
                    <h5>2.3.2 Number of Hosts per Subnet</h5>
                    <p>The number of hosts per subnet is calculated using the formula:</p>

                    <p>$$\text{Number of Hosts} = 2^m - 2$$</p>
                    <p>where <code>m</code> is the number of bits remaining for the host portion.</p>

                    <p>The subtraction of 2 accounts for the network address (all 0s) and the broadcast address (all 1s) which cannot be assigned to individual hosts.</p>

                    <p>Example: If 3 bits are borrowed from a Class C address, 5 bits remain for hosts:</p>
                    <p>$$2^5 - 2 = 32 - 2 = 30 \text{ hosts per subnet}$$</p>
                </article>

                <h4>2.4 Subnetting Examples</h4>
                <p>Let's explore a practical example of subnetting for a Class C network.</p>

                <article>
                    <h5>2.4.1 Example 1: Subnetting a Class C Network</h5>
                    <p>Consider a network with the IP address <code>192.168.10.0/24</code>. If we borrow 3 bits for subnetting:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Subnet Mask</strong>: <code>255.255.255.224</code> or <code>/27</code></li>
                        <li><strong>Number of Subnets</strong>: <code>2^3 = 8</code></li>
                        <li><strong>Number of Hosts per Subnet</strong>: <code>2^5 - 2 = 30</code></li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>The subnets would be:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><code>192.168.10.0/27</code>: Range <code>192.168.10.1</code> to <code>192.168.10.30</code></li>
                        <li><code>192.168.10.32/27</code>: Range <code>192.168.10.33</code> to <code>192.168.10.62</code></li>
                        <li><code>192.168.10.64/27</code>: Range <code>192.168.10.65</code> to <code>192.168.10.94</code></li>
                        <li>...and so on up to <code>192.168.10.224/27</code></li>
                    </ul>
                </article>

                <article>
                    <h5>2.4.2 Example 2: Subnetting a Class B Network</h5>
                    <p>For a network with the IP address <code>172.16.0.0/16</code> and borrowing 4 bits for subnetting:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Subnet Mask</strong>: <code>255.255.240.0</code> or <code>/20</code></li>
                        <li><strong>Number of Subnets</strong>: <code>2^4 = 16</code></li>
                        <li><strong>Number of Hosts per Subnet</strong>: <code>2^{12} - 2 = 4094</code></li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>The subnets would range from <code>172.16.0.0/20</code> to <code>172.16.240.0/20</code>.</p>

                <h4>2.5 VLSM (Variable Length Subnet Masking)</h4>
                <p>VLSM allows for the creation of subnets with varying sizes within the same network, optimizing IP address usage.</p>

                <p>In traditional subnetting, all subnets are of the same size. VLSM enables more efficient IP address allocation by allowing different subnet masks for different subnets, depending on the required size.</p>

                <p>For example, in a network <code>192.168.1.0/24</code>, you might use <code>/28</code> for smaller subnets and <code>/26</code> for larger ones.</p>

                <h3>3. Configure and Verify IPv4 Addressing</h3>
                <p>Configuring and verifying IPv4 addressing is a crucial step in setting up network devices to ensure they communicate correctly within a network. This process involves assigning IP addresses to devices and verifying that these addresses are correctly configured.</p>

            <article>
                <h4>3.1 Configuring IPv4 Addressing</h4>
                <p>IPv4 addresses can be configured manually (static configuration) or automatically (dynamic configuration) using a protocol such as DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol).</p>

                <article>
                    <h5>3.1.1 Static IPv4 Configuration</h5>
                    <p>Static configuration involves manually assigning an IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway to a device. This method is commonly used for servers, routers, and other critical devices that require a fixed IP address.</p>

                    <p>Example of configuring a static IP address on a Windows machine using the command line:</p>
                    <pre><code class="language-shell">netsh interface ip set address "Local Area Connection" static 192.168.1.10 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.1</code></pre>

                    <p>This command sets the IP address to <code>192.168.1.10</code>, the subnet mask to <code>255.255.255.0</code>, and the default gateway to <code>192.168.1.1</code>.</p>

                <h3>4. Configure and Verify Subnetting</h3>
                <p>Configuring and verifying subnetting involves dividing a network into smaller subnetworks and ensuring that each subnet is correctly configured to communicate within its own network and with other networks. Subnetting helps in efficient IP address allocation, improved network performance, and enhanced security.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>4.1 Configuring Subnetting</h4>
                <p>To configure subnetting, you must determine the subnet mask, assign IP addresses to each subnet, and configure routing between the subnets.</p>

                <article>
                    <h5>4.1.1 Determine the Subnet Mask</h5>
                    <p>The subnet mask determines the division between the network and host portions of an IP address. The subnet mask is chosen based on the number of required subnets and the number of hosts per subnet.</p>

                    <p>Example: For a network <code>192.168.1.0/24</code>, if you want to create 4 subnets, you would borrow 2 bits from the host portion. The new subnet mask would be <code>255.255.255.192</code> or <code>/26</code>.</p>

                    <p>Resulting subnets:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><code>192.168.1.0/26</code>: Hosts range from <code>192.168.1.1</code> to <code>192.168.1.62</code></li>
                        <li><code>192.168.1.64/26</code>: Hosts range from <code>192.168.1.65</code> to <code>192.168.1.126</code></li>
                        <li><code>192.168.1.128/26</code>: Hosts range from <code>192.168.1.129</code> to <code>192.168.1.190</code></li>
                        <li><code>192.168.1.192/26</code>: Hosts range from <code>192.168.1.193</code> to <code>192.168.1.254</code></li>
                    </ul>

                    <h5>4.1.2 Assign IP Addresses to Subnets</h5>
                    <p>Once the subnets are defined, assign IP addresses to devices within each subnet. Ensure that each subnet has a unique range of IP addresses, and avoid overlapping IP addresses between subnets.</p>

                    <p>Example: Assigning IP addresses in the first subnet <code>192.168.1.0/26</code>:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Router: <code>192.168.1.1</code></li>
                        <li>Server: <code>192.168.1.2</code></li>
                        <li>Workstation 1: <code>192.168.1.3</code></li>
                        <li>Workstation 2: <code>192.168.1.4</code></li>

                <h4>5.1 Subnet Mask and CIDR Notation</h4>
                <p>The subnet mask is a 32-bit number that masks an IP address and divides it into network and host parts. It is written in dotted decimal notation, just like an IP address. In CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) notation, the subnet mask is represented as a suffix to the IP address, indicating the number of bits used for the network portion (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24).</p>
                <p>The subnet mask corresponding to /24 is 255.255.255.0, which means the first 24 bits are used for the network part, and the remaining 8 bits are used for the host part.</p>

                <h4>5.2 Calculating Subnets</h4>
                <p>To calculate the number of subnets and the number of hosts per subnet, use the following formulas:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Number of Subnets</strong>: $2^n$, where $n$ is the number of bits borrowed from the host portion.</li>
                    <li><strong>Number of Hosts per Subnet</strong>: $2^{(32 - subnet\_mask\_bits)} - 2$. The subtraction of 2 accounts for the network address and the broadcast address, which cannot be assigned to hosts.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>For example, if you have a /26 subnet mask, 26 bits are used for the network portion, and 6 bits are used for the host portion. This gives $2^6 = 64$ possible IP addresses, with $64 - 2 = 62$ usable for hosts.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>5.3 Subnetting Example</h4>
                <p>Consider an IP address of 192.168.1.0 with a subnet mask of /26:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>IP Address</strong>: 192.168.1.0</li>
                    <li><strong>Subnet Mask</strong>: 255.255.255.192 (/26)</li>
                    <li><strong>Subnet Calculation</strong>: $2^2 = 4$ subnets, each with $64 - 2 = 62$ usable addresses.</li>
                    <li><strong>Subnet Ranges</strong>:
                        <ul>
                            <li>192.168.1.0 - 192.168.1.63</li>
