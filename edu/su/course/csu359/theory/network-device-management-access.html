                <h3>3. HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)</h3>
                <p>HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is an application layer protocol used for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML. It is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web, facilitating the exchange of information between clients (browsers) and servers.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>3.1 Key Concepts of HTTP</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Stateless Protocol</strong>: HTTP is a stateless protocol, meaning each request from a client to a server is treated as independent and does not retain session information.</li>
                    <li><strong>Request-Response Model</strong>: HTTP follows a request-response model, where the client sends an HTTP request, and the server responds with the requested resource (HTML page, image, etc.).</li>
                    <li><strong>Ports</strong>: HTTP typically uses TCP port 80 for communication.</li>
                    <li><strong>Text-based</strong>: HTTP communication is human-readable text.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>3.2 HTTP Request Methods</h4>
                <p>HTTP defines several request methods to perform actions on resources. These methods dictate the type of operation the client wants to perform.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>GET</strong>: Requests data from the server (e.g., retrieving a webpage).</li>
                    <li><strong>POST</strong>: Sends data to the server (e.g., submitting form data).</li>
                    <li><strong>PUT</strong>: Updates a resource on the server.</li>
                    <li><strong>DELETE</strong>: Deletes a resource on the server.</li>
                    <li><strong>HEAD</strong>: Similar to GET but only retrieves the headers, not the resource body.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>3.3 HTTP Message Structure</h4>
                <p>HTTP messages consist of two main components: the request (from the client) and the response (from the server).</p>
                <h5>3.3.1 HTTP Request</h5>
                <p>An HTTP request contains the following elements:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Request Line</strong>: Specifies the method (GET, POST), the URL, and the HTTP version (e.g., HTTP/1.1).</li>
                    <li><strong>Headers</strong>: Provide metadata about the request, such as user-agent and content type.</li>
                    <li><strong>Body</strong>: Optional data sent to the server (mostly used in POST or PUT requests).</li>
                </ul>
                <pre><code class="language-http">GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0
</code></pre>

                <h5>3.3.2 HTTP Response</h5>
                <p>The HTTP response from the server contains the following components:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Status Line</strong>: Specifies the HTTP version, status code (e.g., 200 OK), and status message.</li>
                    <li><strong>Headers</strong>: Provide metadata about the response, such as content type and length.</li>
                    <li><strong>Body</strong>: Contains the resource being requested, such as HTML, image, or JSON data.</li>
                </ul>
                <pre><code class="language-http">HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 1234

&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;...&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>3.4 HTTP Status Codes</h4>
                <p>HTTP status codes are used to indicate the result of the client's request. These codes are divided into five categories:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>1xx Informational</strong>: The request is received, continuing process (e.g., 100 Continue).</li>
                    <li><strong>2xx Success</strong>: The request was successfully received, understood, and accepted (e.g., 200 OK).</li>
                    <li><strong>3xx Redirection</strong>: Further action needs to be taken to complete the request (e.g., 301 Moved Permanently).</li>
                    <li><strong>4xx Client Error</strong>: The request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled (e.g., 404 Not Found).</li>
                    <li><strong>5xx Server Error</strong>: The server failed to fulfill a valid request (e.g., 500 Internal Server Error).</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>4.2 How HTTPS Works</h4>
                <p>HTTPS uses SSL/TLS to encrypt communication between the client and the server. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Step 1: Client Hello</strong>: The client sends a request to the server, asking to establish a secure connection. The client also sends a list of supported cryptographic algorithms.</li>
                    <li><strong>Step 2: Server Hello</strong>: The server responds with its digital certificate and agrees on the encryption algorithm to be used.</li>
                    <li><strong>Step 3: Key Exchange</strong>: The client and server exchange public keys to securely share the session key, which will be used to encrypt and decrypt the communication.</li>
                    <li><strong>Step 4: Secure Communication</strong>: Once the secure connection is established, all data exchanged between the client and the server is encrypted using the session key.</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>SSL/TLS Protocol</strong>: The underlying encryption protocol that secures the communication. SSL has been largely replaced by TLS.</li>
                    <li><strong>Digital Certificates</strong>: Used to authenticate the identity of the server, provided by trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs).</li>
                    <li><strong>Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)</strong>: A system that manages digital certificates and public/private key pairs for secure communication.</li>

            <article>
                <h4>4.4 HTTPS Authentication</h4>
                <p>HTTPS relies on digital certificates to authenticate the identity of the server. These certificates are issued by trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs). The certificate contains the server's public key and information about the CA that issued it. During the HTTPS handshake, the client verifies the certificate before proceeding with the secure connection.</p>

                <h4>4.5 HTTPS Encryption</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Asymmetric Encryption</strong>: HTTPS uses asymmetric encryption (public-private key pairs) during the handshake process to exchange session keys securely.</li>
                    <li><strong>Symmetric Encryption</strong>: After the handshake, symmetric encryption is used for the remainder of the communication, where both the client and server use the same session key.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hashing</strong>: HTTPS uses hashing algorithms (e.g., SHA-256) to ensure data integrity by verifying that data has not been altered in transit.</li>

                <h4>4.8 HTTPS in Practice</h4>
                <p>To implement HTTPS on a website, the following steps are required:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Obtain an SSL/TLS certificate</strong>: The website owner must obtain a certificate from a trusted Certificate Authority (e.g., Let's Encrypt).</li>
                    <li><strong>Install the certificate on the web server</strong>: The server must be configured to use the SSL/TLS certificate for encrypting communications.</li>
                    <li><strong>Redirect HTTP to HTTPS</strong>: Ensure all HTTP requests are redirected to HTTPS to enforce secure communication.</li>
                </ul>
                <pre><code class="language-bash">
# Example: Enforcing HTTPS in Apache

                <h4>5.3 Shells in Console</h4>
                <p>The shell is the program that interprets the commands entered into the console. Different operating systems use different shells:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Bash (Bourne Again Shell)</strong>: Commonly used on Unix-like systems (Linux, macOS). It offers rich scripting capabilities.</li>
                    <li><strong>PowerShell</strong>: A task automation framework used in Windows. It is more powerful than the traditional CMD and integrates with various system tools.</li>
                    <li><strong>Zsh (Z Shell)</strong>: A more feature-rich shell often used as a replacement for Bash, with advanced tab completion and customization features.</li>
                    <li><strong>CMD</strong>: The default shell in Windows, also known as Command Prompt, though it lacks the advanced capabilities of Bash and PowerShell.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>5.4 Standard Input, Output, and Error Streams</h4>
                <p>Console interactions typically involve three standard streams:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Standard Input (stdin)</strong>: Where the console reads input, typically from the keyboard.</li>
                    <li><strong>Standard Output (stdout)</strong>: The default stream where the console writes output (e.g., command results).</li>
                    <li><strong>Standard Error (stderr)</strong>: Where error messages are written. It allows separating error output from normal output.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Redirection of these streams is possible for more complex operations. For example, redirecting the output of one command to a file or another command:</p>
                <pre><code class="language-bash"># Redirect stdout to a file
ls > output.txt

# Redirect stderr to a file
ls nonexistentfile 2> error.txt

# Pipe the output of one command into another
cat file.txt | grep "search_term"
</code></pre>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>5.5 Scripting in the Console</h4>
                <p>The console can be used to write and execute scripts. A script is a series of commands saved in a file that can be executed as a program. Shell scripts (Bash, PowerShell) automate repetitive tasks.</p>
                <pre><code class="language-bash">#!/bin/bash
# Example of a simple Bash script
echo "Starting backup..."
cp -r /source/directory /backup/directory
echo "Backup complete!"
</code></pre>

                <p>Similarly, PowerShell scripts are saved with the <code>.ps1</code> extension and can perform advanced system administration tasks.</p>
                <pre><code class="language-bash"># Example of a PowerShell script
Write-Host "Starting cleanup..."
Remove-Item -Path "C:\Temp\*" -Recurse
Write-Host "Cleanup complete!"
</code></pre>

                <ol>
                    <li>The user attempts to log in to a network device (e.g., router) by providing credentials.</li>
                    <li>The device forwards the credentials to the TACACS+ server for authentication.</li>
                    <li>The TACACS+ server verifies the credentials and responds with authentication success or failure.</li>
                    <li>If authenticated, the server provides authorization details, specifying what the user is allowed to do.</li>
                    <li>The server logs the session details for accounting purposes.</li>

                <h4>6.3 RADIUS Overview</h4>
                <p>RADIUS is an open standard protocol used for network access control, commonly deployed for remote user authentication, such as VPN access, Wi-Fi access, or dial-in services.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Encryption</strong>: Encrypts only the password portion of communication, while other data (e.g., username) is sent in clear text, making it less secure than TACACS+.</li>
                    <li><strong>Combines Authentication and Authorization</strong>: Unlike TACACS+, RADIUS combines authentication and authorization in a single request, reducing flexibility.</li>
                    <li><strong>Transport Protocol</strong>: RADIUS uses UDP, typically over ports 1812 (authentication) and 1813 (accounting).</li>
                    <li><strong>Lightweight and Fast</strong>: Due to its UDP-based nature, RADIUS is often faster and suitable for high-traffic environments.</li>
