                <h4>5.2 Components of VPN</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>VPN Client:</strong> Software installed on the user's device to establish a secure connection to the VPN server.</li>
                    <li><strong>VPN Server:</strong> A remote server that handles encryption, decryption, and secure routing of data between the user and the internet or private network.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tunneling Protocols:</strong> Protocols like PPTP, L2TP, OpenVPN, and IPSec create secure tunnels between the client and server, ensuring data privacy.</li>
                    <li><strong>Encryption Algorithms:</strong> Cryptographic algorithms (e.g., AES-256) are used to encrypt data, making it unreadable to unauthorized parties.</li>
                </ul>
