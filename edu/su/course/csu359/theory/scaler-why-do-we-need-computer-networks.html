                <h3>2. The OSI Model: A Network Design Framework</h3>
                <p>The OSI (Open Systems Interconnect) model provides a standardized way to understand how data travels between computers in a network. It serves as a blueprint for designing systems capable of communicating, regardless of differences in hardware or software. This structure ensures seamless communication between devices running different operating systems such as Windows, Linux, or Android.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h4>2.1 Hosts, Servers, and Communication</h4>
                <p>In networking, any device that participates in data exchange is referred to as a <strong>host</strong>. This can be a computer, smartphone, or IoT device. A <strong>server</strong> is a specialized host that provides information to other hosts. For example, when you visit Amazon.com, your browser communicates with Amazon's server to retrieve the webpage content.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h4>2.2 Protocols: The Language of Communication</h4>
                <p>Protocols are the rules that define how data is transmitted and received. Just as languages follow grammar, computers use protocols to communicate efficiently. Some common protocols include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>HTTP/HTTPS:</strong> Used for web communication.</li>
                    <li><strong>FTP:</strong> File transfer between computers.</li>
                    <li><strong>SMTP:</strong> Sending emails via Outlook or other clients.</li>
                    <li><strong>RDP:</strong> Remotely accessing Windows systems.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h4>2.3 OSI Layers Explained</h4>
                <p>The OSI model is divided into seven layers. Each layer has a specific role in managing data as it flows between devices:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Application Layer:</strong> Handles protocols like HTTP or FTP that software applications use.</li>
                    <li><strong>Presentation Layer:</strong> Manages data formatting, compression, and encryption.</li>
                    <li><strong>Session Layer:</strong> Establishes, manages, and terminates connections.</li>
                    <li><strong>Transport Layer:</strong> Ensures reliable data delivery.</li>
                    <li><strong>Network Layer:</strong> Handles routing and addressing of data packets.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Link Layer:</strong> Manages data transfer between neighboring devices.</li>
                    <li><strong>Physical Layer:</strong> Deals with the physical transmission of data.</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>2.3.1 Example: Layered Communication in Action</h5>
                <p>Imagine a browser requesting a webpage. The request starts at the application layer and travels down to the physical layer, where it is transmitted over the internet. At the receiving end, the data flows back up through the layers until the webpage is displayed on the browser.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h4>2.4 Presentation Layer: Formatting, Compression, and Encryption</h4>
                <p>This layer ensures that data is in a suitable format for the application. It also compresses data to reduce transmission size and encrypts sensitive information for secure transmission. A common encryption method used is SSL, which enhances security in HTTPS connections.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h4>2.5 Session Layer: Managing Connections</h4>
                <p>The session layer is responsible for establishing, managing, and closing sessions. For example, when logging into a website, the session layer ensures your identity is verified and authorized to access specific resources. It also handles logouts and session terminations.</p>

                <h5>2.5.1 Authentication and Authorization</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> Verifies user identity through credentials such as usernames and passwords.</li>
                    <li><strong>Authorization:</strong> Determines if a user has permission to access specific resources.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h4>2.6 The Layered Approach in Network Design</h4>
                <p>By organizing protocols and functions into layers, the OSI model simplifies network design and troubleshooting. Each layer only communicates with its counterpart at the other end, ensuring smooth data transmission.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h3>3. Transport Layer: Ensuring Reliable Data Transfer</h3>
                <p>The transport layer is responsible for breaking data into manageable segments and ensuring it is reliably transmitted between hosts. This layer plays a vital role in providing segmentation, flow control, and error control to manage data efficiently.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h4>3.1 Segmentation</h4>
                <p>Data sent from higher layers is divided into smaller, manageable units called segments. This segmentation makes it easier to transport large data across networks. For example, a 1000-byte message could be broken into 10 segments of 100 bytes each. Each segment is labeled with a sequence number to ensure they can be reassembled correctly at the destination.</p>

                <h5>3.1.1 Sequence Numbers and Port Numbers</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Sequence Number:</strong> Indicates the order of each segment, ensuring that segments can be reassembled correctly, even if they arrive out of order.</li>
                    <li><strong>Port Number:</strong> Identifies the specific application or process the data belongs to. For instance, port 80 is commonly used for HTTP traffic.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h4>3.2 Flow Control</h4>
                <p>Flow control ensures the data transfer rate matches the processing capacity of the receiving device. If the server sends data faster than the recipient can handle, the transport layer adjusts the rate to prevent data loss or overflow.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h4>3.3 Error Control</h4>
                <p>Error control mechanisms detect and correct errors during transmission. Two key components include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Retransmission:</strong> If a segment is lost, the receiver requests the sender to retransmit it.</li>
                    <li><strong>Checksum:</strong> A checksum is added to each segment to verify its integrity. If the data gets corrupted, the receiver requests the segment again.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h4>3.4 TCP vs UDP</h4>
                <p>The transport layer offers two primary protocols:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):</strong> A reliable, connection-oriented protocol that provides acknowledgment for each segment sent, ensuring all data is received without loss. It is slower but guarantees accurate data delivery, making it suitable for web browsing and emails.</li>
                    <li><strong>UDP (User Datagram Protocol):</strong> A faster, connectionless protocol without acknowledgment mechanisms. While some data loss is possible, UDP is ideal for real-time applications like video streaming, where speed is more critical than accuracy.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h4>3.5 Transport Layer in Action with Wireshark</h4>
                <p>Using Wireshark, you can capture and analyze transport layer data. When examining TCP segments, you will see fields like sequence numbers, source port, and destination port. In UDP packets, you can observe port numbers and checksums to verify packet integrity.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h3>4. Network Layer: Routing and Addressing</h3>
                <p>The network layer is responsible for routing packets between devices across networks. It assigns logical IP addresses to each host, enabling communication over different networks.</p>

                <h4>4.1 IP Addressing and Routing</h4>
                <p>Every device on a network is assigned an IP address, which serves as a unique identifier. Routers use IP addresses to determine the best path for transmitting packets across networks.</p>

                <h5>4.1.1 Path Determination</h5>
                <p>The network layer selects the most efficient path for transmitting data from the source to the destination. It uses algorithms based on graph theory to determine the shortest route.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h4>4.2 DNS: Domain Name System</h4>
                <p>The DNS translates human-readable domain names (e.g., amazon.com) into IP addresses, enabling browsers to connect to web servers. Tools like Wireshark allow us to observe the DNS requests and responses exchanged between a host and a DNS server.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h3>5. Data Link Layer: Managing Physical Connections</h3>
                <p>The data link layer governs how data packets are transmitted over physical media like Ethernet cables, Wi-Fi, or fiber optics. It ensures that packets are properly framed for transmission.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h4>5.1 Media Access Control (MAC)</h4>
                <p>The MAC address, a unique identifier assigned to network interface devices, is used to route data within local networks. This layer prevents data collisions by managing access to shared communication channels.</p>

                <h5>5.1.1 Error Detection</h5>
                <p>To ensure data integrity, error detection codes are added to the frame's header or trailer. If errors are detected, the data is retransmitted.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h3>6. Physical Layer: Transmitting Signals</h3>
                <p>The physical layer converts data into electrical, optical, or radio signals, depending on the transmission medium. It transmits these signals over copper cables, fiber optics, or wireless connections like Wi-Fi.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h4>6.1 Signal Encoding</h4>
                <p>Various encoding schemes are used to represent binary data as signals. For example, copper wires use voltage levels, fiber optics use laser pulses, and Wi-Fi employs radio waves.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h4>6.2 Connecting Theory with Practical Tools</h4>
                <p>Wireshark provides insights into how these layers work by capturing live network traffic, helping users observe and understand protocols in action.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h3>7. TCP/IP Model: A Practical Approach to Networking</h3>
                <p>The TCP/IP model simplifies the concepts introduced by the OSI model, offering a practical framework for real-world networking. While the OSI model serves as a theoretical reference, the TCP/IP model is widely implemented in modern networking systems. This model organizes network operations into four layers, streamlining communication and reducing complexity.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h4>7.1 Layers of the TCP/IP Model</h4>
                <p>The TCP/IP model groups similar functions from the OSI model, resulting in a more manageable and efficient structure:</p>

                    <li><strong>Application Layer:</strong> Combines the functions of the OSI model's application, presentation, and session layers. It handles communication protocols like HTTP, DNS, SMTP, and manages security through protocols such as SSL/TLS.</li>
                    <li><strong>Transport Layer:</strong> Responsible for reliable data delivery using protocols like TCP and UDP. It ensures proper segmentation, flow control, and error control, with segments often referred to as datagrams in older references.</li>
                    <li><strong>Network Layer:</strong> Manages packet routing using protocols such as IPv4 and IPv6. It performs the same functions as the OSI model's network layer, focusing on logical addressing and efficient packet delivery.</li>
                    <li><strong>Physical Layer:</strong> Merges the OSI model’s data link and physical layers. It handles the transmission of bits and frames over physical media like Ethernet, fiber optics, or wireless networks.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h4>7.2 Data Units Across Layers</h4>
                <p>The data handled at each layer is referred to differently based on the layer’s role:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Application Layer:</strong> Data</li>
                    <li><strong>Transport Layer:</strong> Segments or Datagrams</li>

                </ul>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h4>7.3 Practical Differences from OSI Model</h4>
                <p>While the OSI model provides a detailed theoretical structure, the TCP/IP model offers a simplified, practical framework. For example, in the TCP/IP model:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The three upper layers of the OSI model are grouped into one application layer.</li>
                    <li>Functions related to media access, which the OSI model distributes across data link and physical layers, are managed within a unified physical layer.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h4>7.4 Real-World Application of TCP/IP</h4>
                <p>Most modern networks, including the internet, operate on the TCP/IP model. Its streamlined structure enables more straightforward development and management of networking applications, making it the backbone of contemporary networking systems.</p>
            </article>
            <article>

            </article>
            <article>
                <h4>8.1 Encoding Methods</h4>
                <h5>8.1.1 Manchester Encoding</h5>
                <p>In Manchester encoding, each clock cycle represents a single bit. The signal's transition in the middle of the clock cycle determines the bit:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If the signal rises in the middle, it represents <strong>1</strong>.</li>
                    <li>If the signal falls in the middle, it represents <strong>0</strong>.</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>8.1.2 Differential Manchester Encoding</h5>
                <p>In differential Manchester encoding:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A <strong>1</strong> is represented by no change in the signal during a clock cycle.</li>
                    <li>A <strong>0</strong> is represented by a transition (either rising or falling) in the middle of the clock cycle.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This encoding ensures synchronization and avoids signal loss during transmission.</p>
