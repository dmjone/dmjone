                    <li><strong>VLAN Assignment:</strong> Each AP is assigned to a VLAN, ensuring that its traffic is isolated from other devices on the network, such as guest networks or internal corporate networks.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This interconnection ensures that APs can send and receive data from wireless devices and route it to the appropriate network segment through the switch.</p>

                <h4>5.2 WLC-to-Switch Interconnection</h4>
                <p>The Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) connects to the network switches to manage the communication between the APs and the core network. The WLC-to-switch connection involves:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Trunk Ports:</strong> WLCs are typically connected to switches via trunk ports that carry multiple VLANs, allowing the WLC to manage different types of traffic such as user data, management, and voice traffic.</li>
                    <li><strong>LAG (Link Aggregation Group):</strong> WLCs often use LAG to connect to the switch using multiple physical links, enhancing bandwidth and ensuring redundancy in case one link fails.</li>
                    <li><strong>High-Speed Connectivity:</strong> Gigabit or higher Ethernet speeds are commonly used for WLC-to-switch connections to handle the large volume of traffic generated by multiple APs.</li>
                    <li><strong>VLAN Configuration:</strong> WLCs require proper VLAN configuration on the switch to ensure that different types of traffic are properly segmented and managed.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This setup ensures efficient data flow between the WLC and the network, allowing the controller to oversee and optimize wireless traffic from the APs.</p>

                <h4>5.3 Switch-to-Switch Interconnection</h4>
                <p>The interconnection between switches is crucial for enabling seamless communication across the network. Switch-to-switch links are typically established using trunk ports. Key points include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Trunk Ports:</strong> Trunk ports are configured on switches to carry traffic from multiple VLANs. This allows switches to route different types of traffic, such as data, management, and voice, across the network.</li>
                    <li><strong>VLAN Tagging:</strong> VLAN tagging (using IEEE 802.1Q) ensures that traffic from various VLANs can be identified and routed correctly as it passes between switches.</li>
                    <li><strong>LAG Between Switches:</strong> In high-bandwidth environments, LAG can be used to aggregate multiple links between switches, increasing the overall bandwidth and providing redundancy.</li>
                    <li><strong>Seamless Communication:</strong> Switch-to-switch interconnection ensures that different network segments can communicate with each other efficiently, facilitating end-to-end network connectivity.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>By using trunk ports and VLAN tagging, switch-to-switch interconnections enable seamless communication across a large network, ensuring that data flows freely between different network devices and segments.</p>
