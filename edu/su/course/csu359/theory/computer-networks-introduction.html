                <h4>0.1 Key Components of a Computer Network</h4>
                <p>Computer networks consist of several key components, each playing a critical role in enabling communication:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Nodes</strong>: Any device connected to the network, including computers, smartphones, and servers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Links</strong>: The communication channels (wired or wireless) that connect nodes, allowing data transmission between them.</li>
                    <li><strong>Network Interface Card (NIC)</strong>: A hardware component in devices that allows them to connect to a network.</li>
                    <li><strong>Routers</strong>: Devices that direct data packets between networks, making decisions about the optimal path for delivery.</li>
                    <li><strong>Switches</strong>: Devices that connect devices within a local area network (LAN) by forwarding data to the correct destination based on MAC addresses.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hubs</strong>: Basic devices that broadcast data to all devices in the network, often considered inefficient compared to switches.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>

                <h4>0.2 Types of Computer Networks</h4>
                <p>Computer networks can be classified based on their size, structure, and purpose:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Local Area Network (LAN)</strong>: A network that covers a small geographical area, such as a home, office, or building. LANs are commonly used for sharing resources like printers and files within a limited area.</li>
                    <li><strong>Wide Area Network (WAN)</strong>: A network that spans large geographical areas, connecting multiple LANs together. The internet is the largest WAN, enabling global connectivity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)</strong>: A network that covers a city or a large campus, typically larger than a LAN but smaller than a WAN.</li>
                    <li><strong>Personal Area Network (PAN)</strong>: A small network designed for personal devices, such as smartphones, tablets, and laptops, often using technologies like Bluetooth or Wi-Fi.</li>
                    <li><strong>Virtual Private Network (VPN)</strong>: A secure network that extends across public networks, allowing users to send and receive data as if their devices were directly connected to a private network.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>0.3 Network Topologies</h4>
                <p>The arrangement or layout of devices in a network is called its topology. Common network topologies include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Bus Topology</strong>: All devices are connected to a single central cable (the bus). Data is sent in both directions, but only one device can transmit at a time.</li>
                    <li><strong>Star Topology</strong>: Devices are connected to a central hub or switch. If the hub fails, the entire network goes down, but the failure of individual devices does not affect the network.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ring Topology</strong>: Devices are connected in a circular manner, with each device connected to two other devices. Data travels in one direction until it reaches its destination.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mesh Topology</strong>: Every device is connected to every other device, providing redundancy and fault tolerance. It is expensive and complex but offers excellent reliability.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hybrid Topology</strong>: A combination of two or more different types of topologies, often used in larger networks to take advantage of the strengths of each topology.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>0.4 Network Protocols</h4>
                <p>Protocols are standardized rules that define how data is transmitted across a network. Common network protocols include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)</strong>: The foundational protocol of the internet, ensuring reliable transmission of data by breaking it into packets and reassembling it at the destination.</li>
                    <li><strong>User Datagram Protocol (UDP)</strong>: A connectionless protocol that allows faster data transmission but without the reliability features of TCP. It is commonly used for streaming and gaming.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/HTTPS)</strong>: The protocol used for transferring web pages on the internet. HTTPS is the secure version, encrypting data for safe communication.</li>
                    <li><strong>Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)</strong>: A protocol used for sending emails over a network.</li>
                    <li><strong>File Transfer Protocol (FTP)</strong>: A protocol used for transferring files between devices on a network.</li>

                <p>The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model is a conceptual framework used to understand how different protocols and devices interact within a network. It has seven layers:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Layer 1: Physical Layer</strong>: Deals with the physical medium of transmission, such as cables and signals.</li>
                    <li><strong>Layer 2: Data Link Layer</strong>: Manages error detection and correction between devices on the same network. It includes MAC addressing.</li>
                    <li><strong>Layer 3: Network Layer</strong>: Responsible for routing data between networks using IP addresses.</li>
                    <li><strong>Layer 4: Transport Layer</strong>: Ensures reliable data transmission, with protocols like TCP and UDP.</li>
                    <li><strong>Layer 5: Session Layer</strong>: Manages sessions or connections between applications on different devices.</li>
                    <li><strong>Layer 6: Presentation Layer</strong>: Ensures that data is presented in a readable format, handling encryption and data compression.</li>
                    <li><strong>Layer 7: Application Layer</strong>: The layer closest to the user, managing network services such as email, file transfer, and web browsing.</li>

                <h4>0.9 Types of Network Architectures</h4>
                <p>Network architecture defines how network resources are structured and shared. Two primary models include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Client-Server Architecture</strong>: In this model, the server provides resources or services, and clients access them. Commonly used in large networks where centralized management is needed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Architecture</strong>: In a P2P network, each device can act as both a client and a server, sharing resources directly without relying on a central server. This architecture is used in small networks or for specific purposes like file-sharing applications.</li>
                </ul>
