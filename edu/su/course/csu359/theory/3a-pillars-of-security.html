                <h3>1. The 3A Pillars of Security</h3>
                <p>The 3A pillars of security refer to three foundational principles that ensure the integrity and safety of information systems. These principles are:</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>1.1 Authentication</h4>
                <p><strong>Authentication</strong> is the process of verifying the identity of a user, system, or entity attempting to access resources. It ensures that the entity is who or what it claims to be.</p>
                <p>The methods of authentication include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Something you know:</strong> Passwords, PINs, or security questions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Something you have:</strong> Smartcards, tokens, or mobile devices (used for OTP).</li>
                    <li><strong>Something you are:</strong> Biometrics, such as fingerprints or facial recognition.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Authentication is the first step in securing access to systems and is often combined with additional security mechanisms for greater protection, like multi-factor authentication (MFA).</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>1.2 Authorization</h4>
                <p><strong>Authorization</strong> defines what an authenticated user or system is allowed to do. After authentication confirms an identity, authorization dictates the level of access or privileges the user has over the resources. It enforces access control based on roles, permissions, or policies.</p>
                <p>Authorization models include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):</strong> Access is determined by roles assigned to the user (e.g., admin, editor).</li>
                    <li><strong>Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC):</strong> Access is determined by user attributes and environment conditions (e.g., time, location).</li>
                    <li><strong>Policy-Based Access Control:</strong> Custom policies determine access rights.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Without proper authorization, even an authenticated user should not be able to perform unauthorized actions or access restricted data.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>1.3 Accounting (Auditing)</h4>
                <p><strong>Accounting</strong>, also referred to as auditing, is the process of keeping track of user actions and system events to monitor activity, identify security breaches, and ensure compliance with security policies. It provides a record of who accessed the system, what actions were performed, and when they occurred.</p>
                <p>Key aspects of accounting include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Logging:</strong> Storing logs of system events, user access, and changes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Audit Trails:</strong> Chronological records of actions taken on the system for investigation purposes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Monitoring:</strong> Continuously tracking system activities to detect suspicious behavior or anomalies.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Accounting ensures accountability and enables security teams to trace incidents and respond to security threats promptly.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>1.4 Relationship Between the 3A Pillars</h4>
                <p>The 3A pillars work together to provide a comprehensive security framework:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> Confirms the user’s identity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Authorization:</strong> Grants or denies access based on the user's identity and permissions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Accounting:</strong> Tracks and monitors user activity to ensure compliance and detect threats.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This layered approach ensures that systems are protected from unauthorized access, misuse, and potential breaches while providing mechanisms to track activity and hold individuals accountable.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h3>2. Authentication</h3>
                <p>Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, device, or system before granting access to a resource. It ensures that the entity trying to gain access is who they claim to be. Authentication is a critical part of cybersecurity, forming the first line of defense against unauthorized access. There are various types of authentication mechanisms, each varying in security strength and implementation.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>2.1 Authentication Factors</h4>
                <p>Authentication typically relies on one or more of the following factors:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Something you know</strong>: This refers to information like passwords, PINs, or security questions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Something you have</strong>: Physical devices like security tokens, smart cards, or mobile phones (used for OTPs).</li>
                    <li><strong>Something you are</strong>: Biometric data, such as fingerprints, retina scans, or facial recognition.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The more factors used in authentication (multi-factor authentication, MFA), the stronger the security.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>2.2 Types of Authentication Mechanisms</h4>
                <p>Several types of authentication mechanisms exist, depending on the requirements of the system and the sensitivity of the data.</p>

                <h5>2.2.1 Password-Based Authentication</h5>
                <p>The most common form of authentication. A user provides a unique password that matches the one stored in the system.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Simple to implement and use.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Vulnerable to brute force attacks, phishing, and poor password practices.</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>2.2.2 Token-Based Authentication</h5>
                <p>This mechanism uses a physical token or digital token (e.g., OTP, JWT) for authentication. The token is issued after an initial login and used to authenticate subsequent requests.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Pros:</strong> More secure than passwords alone, can be used in stateless systems (like REST APIs).</li>
                    <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Tokens can be stolen or compromised if not managed securely.</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>2.2.3 Biometric Authentication</h5>
                <p>Uses the individual's physical characteristics like fingerprints, retina patterns, or facial recognition to authenticate them.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Hard to replicate, unique to each individual.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Expensive, privacy concerns, and potential for false positives/negatives.</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>2.2.4 Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)</h5>
                <p>MFA combines two or more authentication factors to enhance security. For example, using a password along with an OTP sent to the user's phone.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Highly secure due to multiple layers of defense.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Can be inconvenient or slow for the user, requires proper management of all factors.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>2.3 Authentication Protocols</h4>
                <p>Protocols define how authentication data is transmitted and verified between entities. Common protocols include:</p>

                <h5>2.3.1 Kerberos</h5>
                <p>A network authentication protocol that uses a system of tickets to allow nodes to prove their identity in a secure manner.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Strengths:</strong> Strong security in distributed networks, reduces the need for repeated password entry.</li>
                    <li><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Requires time synchronization, complex setup.</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>2.3.2 OAuth</h5>
                <p>An open-standard protocol used for token-based authentication, commonly employed in web applications. It allows third-party services to access resources on behalf of a user without sharing credentials.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Strengths:</strong> Secure delegation of access rights, scalable for API usage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Can be complex to implement correctly, requires secure token management.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>2.4 Authentication vs. Authorization</h4>
                <p>It is important to distinguish between authentication and authorization:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Authentication</strong>: The process of verifying the identity of a user or system.</li>
                    <li><strong>Authorization</strong>: Determines what resources or actions the authenticated entity is allowed to access.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Authentication always precedes authorization, but they are distinct processes. For example, logging into a system (authentication) does not automatically mean the user has access to all system resources (authorization).</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>2.5 Challenges in Authentication</h4>
                <p>Key challenges in implementing secure and user-friendly authentication mechanisms include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Password Management</strong>: Users often choose weak passwords, reuse them across services, or forget them.</li>
                    <li><strong>Phishing Attacks</strong>: Even the most secure systems can be compromised through social engineering attacks targeting authentication credentials.</li>
                    <li><strong>Biometric Data Security</strong>: While biometrics are highly secure, storing and managing this data can create privacy and security risks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Balancing Usability and Security</strong>: Strong authentication mechanisms like MFA can reduce convenience for users, leading to friction and potential security workarounds.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>

                <h3>3. Accounting</h3>
                <p>Accounting is the systematic process of recording, analyzing, summarizing, and reporting financial transactions of a business or individual. It provides a detailed view of the financial health and performance of an entity by keeping track of its revenues, expenses, assets, and liabilities. Accounting ensures that stakeholders, such as managers, investors, and regulators, can make informed decisions based on accurate financial information.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>3.1 Key Components of Accounting</h4>
                <p>Accounting is composed of several key components that are foundational to the entire process:</p>

                <h5>3.1.1 Financial Transactions</h5>
                <p>These are economic events that affect the financial position of a business and must be recorded. Examples include sales, purchases, wages, rent, and taxes.</p>

                <h5>3.1.2 The Accounting Equation</h5>
                <p>The core concept behind accounting is the <strong>accounting equation</strong>, which ensures that the financial statements are balanced:</p>
                <p>
                    $$\text{Assets} = \text{Liabilities} + \text{Equity}$$
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Assets</strong>: Resources owned by the business (cash, inventory, equipment).</li>
                    <li><strong>Liabilities</strong>: Obligations owed to external parties (loans, accounts payable).</li>
                    <li><strong>Equity</strong>: The residual interest in the assets after liabilities are deducted (owner's capital, retained earnings).</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>3.1.3 Double-Entry Accounting</h5>
                <p>Double-entry accounting is a system where every financial transaction affects at least two accounts. This ensures the accounting equation stays balanced. For example, when a business purchases inventory with cash, it increases its inventory account (asset) while reducing its cash account (asset).</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Debit</strong>: An entry on the left side of an account, representing an increase in assets or expenses and a decrease in liabilities or equity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Credit</strong>: An entry on the right side of an account, representing a decrease in assets or expenses and an increase in liabilities or equity.</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>3.1.4 Financial Statements</h5>
                <p>Financial statements are formal records of the financial activities of a business. The primary financial statements include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Income Statement</strong>: Shows the company's revenues, expenses, and profits over a specific period.</li>
                    <li><strong>Balance Sheet</strong>: Provides a snapshot of the company’s financial position, showing assets, liabilities, and equity at a given point in time.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cash Flow Statement</strong>: Tracks the inflows and outflows of cash in the business, categorized into operating, investing, and financing activities.</li>
                    <li><strong>Statement of Retained Earnings</strong>: Details the changes in retained earnings over a period, including profits reinvested in the business and dividends paid to shareholders.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>3.2 Types of Accounting</h4>
                <p>There are several types of accounting, each catering to specific needs and functions:</p>

                <h5>3.2.1 Financial Accounting</h5>
                <p>This type of accounting focuses on preparing financial statements for external stakeholders, such as investors, regulators, and creditors. It follows established accounting standards (such as GAAP or IFRS) to ensure consistency and comparability.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Objective:</strong> Provide a true and fair view of the company's financial performance and position.</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>3.2.2 Managerial Accounting</h5>
                <p>Managerial accounting provides financial information to internal stakeholders, such as managers, to assist in decision-making. It involves budgeting, forecasting, and performance analysis to help optimize business operations.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Objective:</strong> Aid in planning, controlling, and decision-making within the organization.</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>3.2.3 Cost Accounting</h5>
                <p>Cost accounting focuses on calculating the cost of producing goods or services, including direct costs (raw materials, labor) and indirect costs (overheads). It helps businesses determine pricing strategies and improve cost efficiency.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Objective:</strong> Control and reduce costs while maximizing profitability.</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>3.2.4 Tax Accounting</h5>
                <p>Tax accounting focuses on preparing tax returns and ensuring compliance with tax laws. It involves strategies to legally minimize tax liabilities while adhering to the applicable tax regulations.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Objective:</strong> Optimize tax efficiency and compliance with tax laws.</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>3.2.5 Auditing</h5>
                <p>Auditing involves the independent examination of financial statements to ensure accuracy and adherence to accounting standards. It may be internal (conducted by an in-house team) or external (conducted by third-party auditors).</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Objective:</strong> Provide assurance that financial statements are accurate and free from material misstatements.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>3.3 The Accounting Cycle</h4>
                <p>The accounting cycle is the series of steps followed by businesses to prepare and present financial statements. It consists of the following stages:</p>

                <h5>3.3.1 Recording Transactions</h5>
                <p>All financial transactions are recorded in the company's books of accounts, often in journals. This is the first step in the accounting process, where entries are made in both debit and credit accounts.</p>

                <h5>3.3.2 Posting to the Ledger</h5>
                <p>Once recorded in journals, transactions are posted to ledger accounts, which summarize the financial information for each specific account (e.g., cash, accounts payable).</p>

                <h5>3.3.3 Preparing a Trial Balance</h5>
                <p>The trial balance lists all ledger accounts and their balances at a particular date. It ensures that debits and credits are equal, identifying any discrepancies in the accounting records.</p>

                <h5>3.3.4 Adjusting Entries</h5>
                <p>At the end of the accounting period, adjusting entries are made to account for accrued revenues, accrued expenses, prepaid expenses, and other non-cash transactions. This ensures that financial statements reflect the actual financial condition of the business.</p>

                <h5>3.3.5 Preparing Financial Statements</h5>
                <p>Once adjustments are made, the financial statements are prepared, including the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement.</p>

                <h5>3.3.6 Closing the Books</h5>
                <p>The final step in the cycle is closing temporary accounts, such as revenues and expenses, by transferring their balances to permanent accounts (e.g., retained earnings). This prepares the accounts for the next accounting period.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>3.4 Accounting Standards and Regulations</h4>
                <p>Accounting standards are rules and guidelines that businesses follow to ensure consistency and transparency in financial reporting. The two major sets of accounting standards are:</p>

                <h5>3.4.1 Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)</h5>
                <p>GAAP is primarily used in the United States and outlines the standards, conventions, and rules for financial reporting. It ensures that financial statements are comparable and reliable.</p>

                <h5>3.4.2 International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)</h5>
                <p>IFRS is a globally accepted accounting framework used in many countries outside the U.S. It aims to standardize financial reporting across borders, making it easier for international investors to compare companies.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>3.5 Importance of Accounting</h4>
                <p>Accounting serves several critical functions in businesses and organizations:</p>

                <h3>4. Authorization</h3>
                <p>Authorization is the process of granting or denying access to specific resources, functions, or data within a system after the user or system has been authenticated. While authentication confirms the identity of the entity, authorization determines what that entity is allowed to do within the system. It acts as a gatekeeper, enforcing rules and policies regarding the access rights of users or devices.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>4.1 Authorization Models</h4>
                <p>Different models of authorization exist to manage access control based on various criteria:</p>

                <h5>4.1.1 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)</h5>
                <p>RBAC assigns access rights based on predefined roles within an organization. Users are granted roles, and those roles determine their level of access to resources.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Simplifies access management by grouping permissions into roles.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Less flexible if users need more granular or specific permissions.</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>4.1.2 Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)</h5>
                <p>ABAC uses attributes associated with users, resources, and the environment to determine access permissions. Attributes may include user identity, resource type, time of access, and location.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Highly flexible, allowing fine-grained control over access.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Complex to implement and maintain due to the wide range of possible attributes.</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>4.1.3 Discretionary Access Control (DAC)</h5>
                <p>In DAC, the owner of a resource decides who can access it. The resource owner has full control over access rights and can share them with others at their discretion.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Simple and intuitive for resource owners to control access.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Less secure, as access rights may be freely shared, leading to potential misuse.</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>4.1.4 Mandatory Access Control (MAC)</h5>
                <p>MAC is a highly restrictive model where access rights are enforced by a central authority, often based on security classifications (e.g., confidential, top secret). Users cannot modify these access rights.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Extremely secure, typically used in government or military settings.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Inflexible, difficult to manage in less rigid environments.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>4.2 Types of Authorization</h4>
                <p>Authorization can take different forms based on how and when access is determined:</p>

                <h5>4.2.1 Static Authorization</h5>
                <p>In static authorization, permissions are predefined and rarely change. These are set at the time of user or resource creation.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Use case:</strong> Suitable for systems where users have stable roles and responsibilities that do not change frequently.</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>4.2.2 Dynamic Authorization</h5>
                <p>Dynamic authorization adjusts permissions in real-time based on the current context, such as user location, time, or device being used.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Use case:</strong> Common in environments where access policies need to adapt to real-time conditions, such as sensitive data access outside of office hours.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>4.3 Authorization Techniques</h4>
                <p>Several methods are used to enforce authorization:</p>

                <h5>4.3.1 Access Control Lists (ACLs)</h5>
                <p>An <a href="/edu/su/course/csu359/theory/configure-and-verify-access-control-lists">ACL</a> specifies which users or systems have access to a resource and what actions they can perform on that resource. For example, an ACL may define read, write, or execute permissions for different users.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Strengths:</strong> Simple to implement, commonly used in file systems and networks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Can become cumbersome to manage as the number of resources and users grows.</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>4.3.2 Policy-Based Access Control</h5>
                <p>This method uses policies defined by administrators to enforce access control. Policies are typically written in a declarative language that specifies what access is allowed under certain conditions.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Strengths:</strong> Fine-grained control over access, highly scalable.</li>
                    <li><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Requires careful planning and policy design to avoid conflicts or excessive complexity.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>4.4 Authorization Protocols</h4>
                <p>Authorization protocols are used to facilitate secure access control between systems and services. The most common authorization protocols include:</p>

                <h5>4.4.1 OAuth 2.0</h5>
                <p>OAuth 2.0 is widely used for delegating access rights to third-party applications. It allows a user to grant limited access to their resources without sharing their credentials.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Strengths:</strong> Secure delegation of access, common in web APIs and third-party services.</li>
                    <li><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Token management must be done securely to prevent attacks.</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>4.4.2 OpenID Connect (OIDC)</h5>
                <p>OIDC is built on top of OAuth 2.0 and adds identity verification features. It allows for both authentication and authorization, making it ideal for single sign-on (SSO) implementations.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Strengths:</strong> Combines identity and authorization into one protocol, simplifying the process for users.</li>
                    <li><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Requires proper implementation of both OAuth 2.0 and OIDC specifications to avoid vulnerabilities.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>4.5 Authorization vs. Authentication</h4>
                <p>While these two processes are often linked, they serve distinct purposes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Authentication</strong>: Confirms the identity of a user or system.</li>
                    <li><strong>Authorization</strong>: Determines what actions the authenticated user is allowed to perform.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>For example, when logging into a banking app, authentication ensures that you are the account holder, and authorization determines what actions you can take within the app (e.g., viewing balances, transferring funds).</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>4.6 Challenges in Authorization</h4>
                <p>Implementing robust authorization mechanisms faces several challenges:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Granularity of Control</strong>: Striking a balance between too broad or too narrow access permissions can be difficult, especially in large organizations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Policy Management</strong>: Managing complex policies for thousands of users and resources becomes challenging, particularly in dynamic environments.</li>
                    <li><strong>Scalability</strong>: As organizations grow, ensuring that authorization systems scale efficiently is critical to avoid performance bottlenecks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Over-Privileged Access</strong>: Users may accumulate excessive access rights over time, creating security risks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Compliance Requirements</strong>: Authorization systems must meet regulatory standards such as GDPR, HIPAA, and others, which can add additional complexity.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>5. Case Study: Understanding Accounting, Authentication, and Authorization</h3>
                <p>Lets take a case study which involves a mid-sized e-commerce company called <strong>ShopKart</strong>. ShopKart sells various consumer products online, and like most businesses, it relies on accounting, authentication, and authorization to operate efficiently and securely. This example will show how these three concepts are applied in real-world business operations.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>5.1 Background</h4>
                <p>ShopKart has grown significantly over the past five years and now processes thousands of transactions daily. It needs to maintain accurate financial records, secure access to its systems, and ensure that only authorized individuals can access sensitive financial data or make decisions regarding business operations.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>5.2 Accounting at ShopKart</h4>
                <p>Accounting is critical for ShopKart to track its revenues, expenses, assets, and liabilities. The company uses accounting software to manage the following activities:</p>

                <h5>5.2.1 Recording Transactions</h5>
                <p>Every time a customer makes a purchase, the sale is recorded as a revenue transaction in ShopKart's accounting system. Similarly, when the company purchases inventory from suppliers, it records these as expenses. All transactions follow the double-entry accounting method, where revenue and expenses are balanced against cash inflows and outflows.</p>

                <h5>5.2.2 Financial Statements</h5>
                <p>At the end of each quarter, ShopKart prepares its financial statements using the <strong>accounting equation</strong>:
                </p>
                <p>$$\text{Assets} = \text{Liabilities} + \text{Equity}$$</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Income Statement:</strong> Shows ShopKart’s sales revenues, cost of goods sold (COGS), and net profit for the quarter.</li>
                    <li><strong>Balance Sheet:</strong> Provides a snapshot of the company’s financial health, showing its assets (cash, inventory, equipment), liabilities (loans, accounts payable), and equity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cash Flow Statement:</strong> Tracks the company’s cash inflows and outflows, categorized by operating, investing, and financing activities.</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>5.2.3 Compliance and Tax Accounting</h5>
                <p>ShopKart complies with Indian tax regulations by preparing its tax returns through the Goods and Services Tax (GST) system. The company uses <strong>tax accounting</strong> to ensure that its tax liabilities are minimized within the legal framework. Tax auditors periodically review ShopKart’s financial records to ensure compliance with Indian accounting standards and tax laws.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>5.3 Authentication at ShopKart</h4>
                <p>To protect its e-commerce platform and internal systems, ShopKart uses several authentication mechanisms to verify the identity of its users, including employees, customers, and partners.</p>

                <h5>5.3.1 Password-Based Authentication</h5>
                <p>Employees log into ShopKart's financial and operational systems using unique usernames and passwords. For added security, ShopKart enforces strong password policies, requiring a combination of letters, numbers, and special characters.</p>

                <h5>5.3.2 Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</h5>
                <p>Given the sensitive nature of financial data, ShopKart implements <strong>two-factor authentication (2FA)</strong> for its senior management and finance team. This involves a combination of a password (something you know) and an OTP sent to their mobile phones (something you have). This ensures that even if a password is compromised, unauthorized access to financial systems is prevented.</p>

                <h5>5.3.3 Biometric Authentication</h5>
                <p>For high-security access, such as warehouse operations and stock management, ShopKart uses <strong>biometric authentication</strong> (something you are), including fingerprint scanning. This provides an additional layer of security, ensuring that only authorized personnel can access restricted areas.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>5.4 Authorization at ShopKart</h4>
                <p>Authorization at ShopKart determines what actions each employee or system user can perform within the company’s platform. This ensures that only authorized individuals can access or modify sensitive financial and operational data.</p>

                <h5>5.4.1 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)</h5>
                <p>ShopKart uses a <strong>Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)</strong> model for managing access. Employees are assigned specific roles based on their job functions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Finance Team:</strong> Can access financial records, generate financial statements, and process payments.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sales Team:</strong> Can view customer orders, process shipments, but cannot access financial data.</li>
                    <li><strong>Warehouse Staff:</strong> Can update inventory data but have no access to sales or financial information.</li>
                    <li><strong>IT Administrators:</strong> Have full access to the systems but cannot modify financial or sales data without approval.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>By using RBAC, ShopKart ensures that employees have access only to the information necessary for their roles, reducing the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive data.</p>

                <h5>5.4.2 Policy-Based Access Control</h5>
                <p>In addition to RBAC, ShopKart uses <strong>Policy-Based Access Control</strong> (PBAC) to set specific conditions for access. For instance, financial data can only be accessed during business hours, and certain actions, such as approving large transactions, require authorization from two senior managers.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>5.5 Application of Concepts in a Real-World Scenario</h4>
                <p>Consider a situation where ShopKart’s CFO wants to review the company’s financial statements for the last quarter. Here’s how accounting, authentication, and authorization come into play:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> The CFO logs into the financial system using 2FA, entering both their password and an OTP sent to their mobile phone.</li>
                    <li><strong>Authorization:</strong> Since the CFO has the highest level of financial access, they are authorized to view and edit the financial statements. Other employees, such as junior accountants, may only have viewing rights.</li>
                    <li><strong>Accounting:</strong> The CFO reviews the balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement prepared by the accounting team. They ensure that the financials align with the company’s assets, liabilities, and revenues, and then prepare the tax filings based on this data.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This scenario illustrates how these three critical concepts—accounting, authentication, and authorization—work together in a real-world business context to ensure secure and accurate financial operations.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>5.6 Conclusion</h4>
                <p>In ShopKart’s case, accounting ensures that the company’s financial data is accurate and compliant with Indian tax laws, authentication guarantees that only authorized users access the system, and authorization defines what actions those users can perform. Together, these concepts ensure that the business operates efficiently, securely, and transparently, maintaining trust with both internal and external stakeholders.</p>
