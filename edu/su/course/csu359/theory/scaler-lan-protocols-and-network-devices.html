                <h3>1. Ethernet IEEE 802.3</h3>
                <p>Ethernet is a widely used protocol under IEEE 802.3 standards for local area networks (LAN). These networks are designed for connecting devices within a limited area like homes, offices, or labs, ensuring data exchange through a common framework. Let's explore the key features and structure of Ethernet.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>1.1 Evolution and Speed Variants</h4>
                <p>Ethernet has evolved to accommodate increasing data speeds:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Early versions: 2.94 Mbps</li>
                    <li>Progression to 10 Mbps, 100 Mbps, 1 Gbps, 25 Gbps, and even 100 Gbps</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Modern Ethernet typically relies on fiber optic cables to support higher data rates efficiently.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>1.2 Physical Connections and Topology</h4>
                <p>Ethernet follows a bus topology for its communication model. Devices (hosts) are connected to a common transmission medium. Ethernet cables, commonly found in homes and offices, connect computers to routers or switches for data exchange.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>1.3 CSMA/CD: Medium Access Control</h4>
                <p>Ethernet uses Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) to manage data transmission:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>No Acknowledgments:</strong> Devices transmit without waiting for confirmation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Collision Handling:</strong> If collisions occur, devices detect them and retransmit data using the exponential back-off algorithm.</li>
                    <li><strong>Physical Layer:</strong> Uses Manchester encoding for synchronization between sender and receiver clocks.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>1.4 Ethernet Frame Structure</h4>
                <div class="mermaid">
                    graph LR
                    Preamble["Preamble (8 bytes)"] --> Destination["Destination Address (6 bytes)"]
                    Destination --> Source["Source Address (6 bytes)"]
                    Source --> Length_Type["Length/Type (2 bytes)"]
                    Length_Type --> Data_Padding["Data + Padding (variable)"]
                    Data_Padding --> CRC["CRC (4 bytes)"]
                </div>
                <p>The frame consists of several sections:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Preamble:</strong> Synchronizes sender and receiver clocks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Destination and Source Addresses:</strong> 48-bit MAC addresses represented in hexadecimal (12 nibbles).</li>
                    <li><strong>Length/Type:</strong> Specifies the data size or protocol type.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data + Padding:</strong> Contains the payload from upper layers, padded to maintain the minimum frame size.</li>
                    <li><strong>CRC:</strong> A 32-bit cyclic redundancy check for error detection.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>1.5 Frame Size Constraints</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Minimum Size:</strong> 64 bytes to ensure collision detection works properly. This helps meet the condition $TT \gt 2 \times TP$, where $L = \frac{TT \cdot B}{D}$, ensuring the frame propagates across the network for reliable collision detection.</li>
                    <li><strong>Maximum Size:</strong> 1518 bytes to prevent any one host from monopolizing the transmission medium.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>1.6 Protocol Efficiency</h4>
                <p>Efficiency is calculated by comparing the data size with the total frame size:</p>
                <p>Efficiency = (Data Size / Total Frame Size) × 100</p>
                <p>$= (1500 / 1518) \times 100 ≈ 98.81%$</p>
                <p>While protocol efficiency measures payload capacity, it differs from channel efficiency, which accounts for transmission delays and other factors.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>1.7 Handling Collisions</h4>
                <p>With CSMA/CD, collisions are expected but managed through retransmissions. However, unpredictable retransmission times can make real-time applications (like video calls) challenging. Advances in network infrastructure (e.g., fiber optic broadband) have improved performance, allowing Ethernet to support live streams and video calls, despite occasional packet losses.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>1.8 Practical Considerations</h4>
                <p>Despite Ethernet’s theoretical limitations in handling real-time applications, modern implementations with faster cables and better bandwidth make Ethernet a reliable choice for streaming and communication today. Some performance drops during live sessions can still occur, often due to minor packet loss.</p>

                <h3>2. Token Ring Protocol (IEEE 802.5)</h3>
                <p>The Token Ring protocol, defined under IEEE 802.5, operates using a token-based strategy to manage data transmission within a network. While not as prevalent as Ethernet or wireless LAN, it offers unique advantages for specific use cases. Let’s explore its workings and structure in detail.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>2.1 Key Characteristics</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Encoding:</strong> Uses differential Manchester encoding for synchronization and data transmission.</li>
                    <li><strong>Transmission Strategy:</strong> Employs token passing to prevent collisions. Only the host with the token can transmit.</li>
                    <li><strong>Speeds:</strong> Early speeds were 4 Mbps, progressing to 16 Mbps and even 1 Gbps in modern implementations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Topology:</strong> Requires a logical ring topology, though it need not be physically circular.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>2.2 Token Passing and Priority Control</h4>
                <p>Token passing allows a host holding the token to transmit data, giving it control over the medium. This enables prioritization among hosts:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Priority is assigned by controlling the time each host holds the token.</li>
                    <li>Client-server architectures leverage this prioritization, where the server holds the token longer for faster data transmission.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>

                <h4>2.4 Monitor Node and Error Handling</h4>
                <p>The monitor node plays a crucial role in error detection and token management:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Monitor Bit:</strong> Identifies orphan or corrupted packets and removes them from the network.</li>
                    <li><strong>Token Management:</strong> Ensures token availability through maximum token return time monitoring. If the token is lost or captured, the monitor generates a new one.</li>
                    <li><strong>Heartbeat Messages:</strong> Periodically sends control frames to indicate that the monitor is active.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>2.5 Handling Destination and Token Issues</h4>
                <p>The protocol uses several mechanisms to manage transmission challenges:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Available and Copy Bits:</strong> The destination sets these bits to indicate availability and successful copying of data.</li>
                    <li><strong>Token Loss or Capture:</strong> If a token is not returned within the allowed time, the monitor intervenes and reissues a new token.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>2.6 Real-time Communication</h4>
                <p>Token Ring’s deterministic nature makes it suitable for real-time communication. Since there are no collisions, the maximum frame transmission time can be precisely calculated, enabling real-time applications in specialized environments, such as inter-office communication and corporate video conferencing.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>2.7 Limitations and Practical Use</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Single Point of Failure:</strong> The monitor node represents a critical vulnerability. If it fails, the entire network may halt until manual intervention restores operation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reduced Adoption:</strong> Token Ring was historically popular in IBM environments but is now limited to niche corporate uses, where precise control over transmissions is required.</li>
                    <li><strong>Modern Alternatives:</strong> Ethernet and wireless LAN have largely replaced Token Ring at the consumer level.</li>

            <article>
                <h4>2.8 Example Calculation</h4>
                <p>Consider a scenario where each node holds the token for 1 millisecond, and the network bandwidth is 16 Mbps. The maximum frame size can be computed as:</p>
                <p>Max Frame Size: <br>Max Frame Size = Bandwidth $\times$ Token Holding Time</p>
                <p>
                    $= 16 \times 10^6 \, \text{bits/sec} \times 1 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{sec}$
                </p>
                <p>
                    $= 16,000 \, \text{bits}$
                </p>
                <p>The maximum frame size depends on the holding time and network bandwidth, ensuring fair use of the medium.</p>

                <h4>3.2 Frequency Bands</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>2.4 GHz Band:</strong> This frequency supports 3 channels, making it more prone to interference.</li>
                    <li><strong>5 GHz Band:</strong> Provides 23 non-overlapping channels, enabling faster and more reliable communication.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The 5 GHz band offers greater bandwidth, reducing contention between devices and increasing overall network speed.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>3.3 Non-overlapping Channels</h4>
                <p>The 5 GHz band supports multiple non-overlapping channels, each with a bandwidth of 20 MHz:</p>
                <pre><code class="">
Channel 1: 5.00 - 5.02 GHz
Channel 2: 5.02 - 5.04 GHz
...
Channel 23: 5.44 - 5.46 GHz
</code></pre>
                <p>These channels operate independently, allowing simultaneous data transmissions without interference between them.</p>

            <article>
                <h4>3.4 Duplex Communication</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Half-Duplex Channels:</strong> Each channel supports communication in only one direction at a time.</li>
                    <li><strong>Efficient Data Transfer:</strong> Devices select different channels to avoid interference, enhancing data transfer efficiency.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>5. Network Segmentation, Collision Domain, and Broadcast Domain</h3>
                <p>To understand why routers and switches are the most popular network devices, we need to explore three key concepts: network segmentation, collision domains, and broadcast domains. These concepts help us grasp how data flows efficiently across networks and why certain devices are preferred over others.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Definition:</strong> A network segment is a collection of hosts and devices that operate within the same part of a network.</li>
                    <li><strong>Example:</strong> A group of devices connected to a switch can form a segment, such as LAN1, LAN2, etc.</li>
                    <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Segments help localize traffic and enhance performance by grouping related devices.</li>

                    <li><strong>Hub vs. Switch:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Hub:</strong> Entire hub network is a single collision domain. Packets from any device can collide with others.</li>
                            <li><strong>Switch:</strong> Each port on a switch creates a separate collision domain, reducing the chance of collisions.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Switch vs. Router:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Switch:</strong> Cannot break broadcast domains since it operates at the data link layer (MAC addresses).</li>
                            <li><strong>Router:</strong> Breaks broadcast domains by filtering based on IP addresses, limiting broadcasts to specific segments.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Router Advantage:</strong> By managing broadcast domains, routers prevent unnecessary traffic from propagating across networks, improving efficiency.</li>

                <h4>5.4 Why Routers Are More Popular</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>IP Address Filtering:</strong> Routers operate at the network layer, allowing them to route packets intelligently using IP addresses.</li>
                    <li><strong>Broadcast Control:</strong> Routers contain broadcasts within specific segments, improving network efficiency.</li>
                    <li><strong>Path Selection:</strong> Routers use routing tables to determine the best path for data, optimizing traffic flow across networks.</li>

                <h3>6. Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)</h3>
                <p>The Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) is a crucial networking protocol designed to prevent loops in Ethernet networks. It draws directly from the concept of spanning trees in graph theory, ensuring that a network topology remains loop-free while still maintaining redundancy for fault tolerance. This section explains the need for STP, its working, and how it is implemented in real-world networks.</p>

                <h4>6.1 Why Do We Need Spanning Tree Protocol?</h4>
                <p>When switches or bridges are interconnected with multiple paths, loops can form. These loops can lead to infinite packet circulation through a process called flooding, which occurs when a switch doesn't know the destination MAC address. Without STP, loops can overwhelm a network with redundant packets, wasting bandwidth and leading to network failure.</p>

                <h4>6.2 How Loops Occur in a Network</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Redundant Connections:</strong> Redundant paths are often added between switches to increase network reliability.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flooding:</strong> When a switch receives a packet for an unknown destination, it floods the packet on all its ports.</li>
                    <li><strong>Infinite Loops:</strong> With loops in the topology, flooded packets circulate endlessly, causing network congestion.</li>

                    <li><strong>Spanning Tree in Networks:</strong> A spanning tree ensures only one active path exists between any two devices, eliminating loops.</li>
                    <li><strong>Preserving Redundancy:</strong> Extra paths remain inactive unless the primary path fails, maintaining reliability.</li>

                <h4>6.4 How Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) Works</h4>
                <p>STP prevents loops by identifying redundant paths and placing them in a blocking state. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the process:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Root Bridge Election:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Every switch has a unique MAC address.</li>
                            <li>Switches exchange configuration messages (called Bridge Protocol Data Units, BPDU).</li>
                            <li>The switch with the lowest MAC address is elected as the root bridge.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Path Cost Calculation:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Each switch calculates the shortest path to the root bridge based on hop counts or propagation delay.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Port States:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Some ports are set to "blocking" mode to eliminate loops.</li>
                            <li>Active paths remain in "forwarding" mode, transmitting data.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Redundant Links:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Non-active links remain in a standby state, ready to become active if the primary path fails.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h4>6.5 Example: Building a Spanning Tree</h4>
                <p>Consider a network with four switches, B1, B2, B3, and B4. Each switch exchanges BPDUs to determine the root bridge, which is the switch with the lowest MAC address. If B1 has the smallest MAC address, it becomes the root. The shortest paths are calculated from the root, and redundant links are blocked to prevent loops.</p>
