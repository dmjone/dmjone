                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Data transmission</strong> (also data communication or digital communications) is the transfer of data (a digital bit-stream or a digitized analog signal) over a point-to-point or point-to-multi-point communication channel.</li>
                    <li>Examples of such channels are copper wire, optical fibers, wireless communication channels, storage media, and computer buses.</li>
                    <li>The data are represented as an electromagnetic signal, such as an electrical voltage, radio wave, microwave, or infrared signal.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Data Communication</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Computer network</strong> is a digital telecommunications network which allows nodes to share resources.</li>
                    <li>In computer networks, computing devices exchange data with each other using connections (data links) between nodes.</li>
                    <li>Data links are established over cable media such as wires or fiber optic cables, or wireless media such as Wi-Fi.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Data Communication and Computer Network</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Data communications</strong> refers to the transmission of digital data between two or more computers, and a computer network or data network is a telecommunications network that allows computers to exchange data.</li>
                    <li>The physical connection between networked computing devices is established using either cable media or wireless media.</li>
                    <li>The best-known computer network is the Internet.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Computer systems and peripherals are connected to form a network. They provide numerous advantages:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Resource sharing such as printers and storage devices</li>
                        <li>Exchange of information by means of e-Mails and FTP</li>
                        <li>Information sharing by using Web or Internet</li>
                        <li>Interaction with other users using dynamic web pages</li>

                <h4>How Many Kinds of Networks?</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Depending on one's perspective, we can classify networks in different ways:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Based on network size: LAN and WAN (and MAN)</li>
                        <li>Based on transmission media: Wired (UTP, coaxial cables, fiber-optic cables) and Wireless</li>
                        <li>Based on management method: Peer-to-peer and Client/Server</li>
                        <li>Based on topology (connectivity): Bus, Star, Ring, etc.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>Based on Geographical Span (Network Size)</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Generally, networks are distinguished based on their geographical span (network size). A network can be as small as the distance between your mobile phone and its Bluetooth headphone and as large as the internet itself, covering the whole geographical world.</li>
                    <li><strong>Personal Area Network (PAN)</strong> is the smallest network, which is very personal to a user. This may include Bluetooth-enabled devices or infra-red enabled devices.</li>
                    <li><strong>Local Area Network (LAN)</strong> A computer network spanned inside a building and operated under a single administrative system. Usually, LAN covers an organization's offices, schools, colleges, or universities.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) generally expands throughout a city, such as a cable TV network. It can be in the form of Ethernet, Token-ring, ATM, or Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI).</li>
                    <li>Metro Ethernet is a service provided by ISPs. This service enables its users to expand their Local Area Networks. For example, MAN can help an organization connect all of its offices in a city.</li>
                    <li>The backbone of MAN is high-capacity and high-speed fiber optics. MAN works between Local Area Network and Wide Area Network. MAN provides uplink for LANs to WANs or the internet.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>Wide Area Network (WAN)</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Wide Area Network (WAN) covers a wide area, which may span across provinces and even a whole country. Generally, telecommunication networks are Wide Area Networks. These networks provide connectivity to MANs and LANs.</li>
                    <li>Since they are equipped with a very high-speed backbone, WANs use very expensive network equipment.</li>
                    <li>WAN may use advanced technologies such as Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM), Frame Relay, and Synchronous Optical Network (SONET).</li>
                    <li>WAN may be managed by multiple administrations.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>

                <h4>Based on Transmission Media</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Two main categories:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Guided ― wires, cables</li>
                        <li>Unguided ― wireless transmission, e.g., radio, microwave, infrared, sound, solar</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>We will concentrate on guided media here:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Twisted-Pair cables:</strong></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Unshielded Twisted-Pair (UTP) cables</li>
                            <li>Shielded Twisted-Pair (STP) cables</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Coaxial cables</li>
                        <li>Fiber-optic cables</li>
                    </ul>

                    <li><strong>Network architecture</strong> is the design of a computer network. It is a framework for the specification of a network's physical components and their functional organization and configuration, its operational principles and procedures, as well as communication protocols used.</li>
                    <li>Computer networks can be discriminated into various types such as Client-Server, peer-to-peer, or hybrid, depending upon its architecture.</li>
                    <li>There can be one or more systems acting as Server (Client Server). Others being Client, request the Server to serve requests. The server takes and processes requests on behalf of Clients.</li>
                    <li>Two systems can be connected Point-to-Point, or in back-to-back fashion. They both reside at the same level and are called peers.</li>
                    <li>There can be a hybrid network that involves the network architecture of both the above types.</li>

                    <li>A network protocol defines rules and conventions for communication between network devices.</li>
                    <li>Network protocols include mechanisms for devices to identify and make connections with each other, as well as formatting rules that specify how data is packaged into sent and received messages.</li>
                    <h5>Internet Protocols</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The Internet Protocol (IP) family contains a set of related (and among the most widely used) network protocols. Besides Internet Protocol itself, higher-level protocols like TCP, UDP, HTTP, and FTP all integrate with IP to provide additional capabilities. Similarly, lower-level Internet Protocols like ARP and ICMP also coexist with IP. In general, higher-level protocols in the IP family interact more closely with applications like web browsers, while lower-level protocols interact with network adapters and other computer hardware.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>On the Internet, the set of communications protocols used is called TCP/IP. TCP/IP is actually a collection of various protocols that each have their own special function or purpose.</li>
                    <li>Examples: 802.11b Protocol, 802.11g Protocol, 802.11a Protocol, etc.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Routing protocols are special-purpose protocols designed specifically for use by network routers on the internet. A routing protocol can identify other routers, manage the pathways (called routes) between sources and destinations of network messages, and make dynamic routing decisions. Common routing protocols include EIGRP, OSPF, and BGP.</li>
