                <h3>1. Router</h3>
                <p>A router is a networking device that forwards data packets between different networks. It operates at the network layer (Layer 3) of the OSI model and is crucial in ensuring that data reaches its correct destination across interconnected networks. Routers make intelligent decisions about the best path for forwarding data packets based on the destination IP address and other network conditions. Routers interconnect local area networks (LANs) and wide area networks (WANs), forming the backbone of the internet.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h4>1.1 Functions of a Router</h4>
                <p>Routers are equipped with multiple functionalities that make them essential in modern computer networks. Some of the key functions include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Packet Forwarding</strong>: Routers inspect the destination IP address of each packet and forward it to the appropriate next hop toward its destination.</li>
                    <li><strong>Routing</strong>: Routers use routing tables and algorithms (such as RIP, OSPF, BGP) to determine the optimal path for forwarding packets.</li>
                    <li><strong>Network Address Translation (NAT)</strong>: Routers can perform NAT, allowing multiple devices on a local network to share a single public IP address for accessing the internet.</li>
                    <li><strong>Firewall Capabilities</strong>: Many routers come with built-in firewall features, enabling them to block unwanted traffic based on predefined rules.</li>
                    <li><strong>Traffic Management</strong>: Routers can prioritize certain types of traffic using Quality of Service (QoS) to ensure important data (e.g., video calls) gets transmitted smoothly.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h4>1.2 Routing Tables</h4>
                <p>A routing table is a database in the router that stores the paths to different network destinations. It consists of entries that specify the destination network, next hop, and associated metrics. Routers refer to this table to determine where to forward packets.</p>
                <p>The basic structure of a routing table contains the following information:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Destination Network</strong>: The network address to which the data is destined.</li>
                    <li><strong>Next Hop</strong>: The IP address of the next router or device that the packet should be forwarded to.</li>
                    <li><strong>Metric</strong>: A value that represents the cost of a route, with lower values indicating a better route (e.g., hop count, bandwidth).</li>
                    <li><strong>Interface</strong>: The network interface on which the router forwards the packet.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h4>1.3 Types of Routers</h4>
                <p>There are several types of routers, each suited for different environments and use cases:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Core Routers</strong>: These are high-performance routers used within the core of a network, typically in large enterprise or ISP networks, to manage high-speed traffic and connect major networks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Edge Routers</strong>: Positioned at the boundary of a network, edge routers manage data traffic entering and leaving the network. They often perform NAT and filtering functions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Wireless Routers</strong>: These routers provide wireless connectivity (Wi-Fi) in addition to routing functions, commonly used in homes and small businesses.</li>
                    <li><strong>Virtual Routers</strong>: Software-based routers that run on general-purpose hardware or cloud infrastructure, used for flexible and scalable routing in virtualized environments.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h4>1.4 Routing Protocols</h4>
                <p>Routers use routing protocols to dynamically share and update information about network topology. This helps in determining the best route for forwarding packets. Key routing protocols include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>RIP (Routing Information Protocol)</strong>: A distance-vector protocol that uses hop count as a metric, best for small networks.</li>
                    <li><strong>OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)</strong>: A link-state protocol that calculates the shortest path using the Dijkstra algorithm, suited for large networks.</li>
                    <li><strong>BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)</strong>: An exterior gateway protocol used to exchange routing information between different autonomous systems on the internet, essential for global routing.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h4>1.5 Router Architecture</h4>
                <p>Routers consist of hardware and software components working together to process packets:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Control Plane</strong>: This is where the routing decisions are made. It runs routing protocols and manages the routing table.</li>
                    <li><strong>Forwarding Plane (Data Plane)</strong>: This handles the actual forwarding of packets, based on the decisions made by the control plane.</li>
                    <li><strong>Interfaces</strong>: Physical or virtual ports that connect the router to networks (e.g., Ethernet ports).</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h4>1.6 Routing Algorithms</h4>
                <p>Routing algorithms are used by routers to determine the best path for packet forwarding. These can be classified into:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Distance-Vector Algorithms</strong>: Each router calculates the distance to destination networks and shares this information with neighboring routers (e.g., RIP).</li>
                    <li><strong>Link-State Algorithms</strong>: Each router has a complete view of the network topology and calculates the shortest path using algorithms like Dijkstra (e.g., OSPF).</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h5>1.6.1 Example of Routing Algorithm (Dijkstra’s Algorithm)</h5>
                <p>Dijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes in a network. Routers using OSPF apply this algorithm to determine the shortest path to destination networks.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Initialize distances from the source to all nodes as infinite, except the source itself (0).</li>
                    <li>Mark all nodes as unvisited.</li>
                    <li>Choose the unvisited node with the smallest known distance.</li>
                    <li>For each neighboring node, calculate the tentative distance through the current node and update if smaller.</li>
                    <li>Mark the current node as visited.</li>
                    <li>Repeat until all nodes are visited.</li>
                </ul>

            </article>
            <article>
                <h4>1.7 Security Considerations</h4>
                <p>Routers are a critical point for enforcing network security. Common security practices include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Access Control Lists (ACLs)</strong>: These allow administrators to define rules for allowing or denying specific traffic based on IP addresses, protocols, or ports.</li>
                    <li><strong>Secure Routing Protocols</strong>: Use secure versions of routing protocols, such as OSPF with authentication or BGP with MD5 hashing, to prevent route hijacking.</li>
                    <li><strong>Firmware Updates</strong>: Regularly updating router firmware is crucial to patch vulnerabilities.</li>
                </ul>

            <article>
                <h3>2. Hubs</h3>
                <p>A hub is a basic networking device used to connect multiple devices in a Local Area Network (LAN). Operating at the physical layer (Layer 1) of the OSI model, hubs function as central points of connection for devices. Unlike more advanced devices such as switches and routers, hubs have limited functionality: they merely replicate the data they receive and broadcast it to all connected devices, without making any routing or switching decisions.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h4>2.1 Types of Hubs</h4>
                <p>There are three main types of hubs, each with slightly different functions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Passive Hub</strong>: Simply connects devices in a network, without any amplification or regeneration of the signal. It does not process or strengthen the signal and is used in small-scale, low-cost networks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Active Hub</strong>: Amplifies and regenerates the signals before forwarding them to connected devices, helping to extend the distance over which the signal can travel.</li>
                    <li><strong>Intelligent Hub</strong>: Adds basic management capabilities to monitor traffic and detect problems in the network. These hubs are typically used in enterprise networks for monitoring and controlling data flows.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h4>2.2 How Hubs Work</h4>
                <p>Hubs operate in a very simple manner:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>When a hub receives data (in the form of electrical signals) from one device, it broadcasts this data to all other connected devices.</li>
                    <li>Every device on the hub receives the data, but only the device for which the data is intended processes it, while the others discard it.</li>
                    <li>Hubs cannot differentiate between different devices or identify the destination of the data; they simply forward the data to all ports.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This method of operation introduces inefficiency and security risks, as all devices receive all traffic, leading to potential collisions and data congestion.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h4>2.3 Hub vs. Switch</h4>
                <p>While hubs and switches are both used to connect devices in a LAN, they have key differences:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Hub</strong>: Broadcasts data to all devices in the network, regardless of the intended recipient. This causes unnecessary traffic and potential data collisions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Switch</strong>: Operates at Layer 2 (Data Link Layer) and is smarter than a hub. It forwards data only to the device that the data is intended for, reducing unnecessary traffic and improving network efficiency.</li>
                    <li><strong>Efficiency</strong>: Hubs are less efficient than switches since they broadcast all data, leading to potential performance degradation in large networks.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h4>2.4 Collision Domain</h4>
                <p>Hubs create a <strong>collision domain</strong>, meaning that all devices connected to the hub share the same communication channel. This increases the likelihood of data collisions when two or more devices attempt to send data at the same time. Collisions force the devices to retransmit data, reducing network efficiency.</p>
                <p>In contrast, switches divide the network into multiple collision domains, significantly reducing the risk of collisions and improving performance.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h4>2.5 Limitations of Hubs</h4>
                <p>Hubs have several limitations that have caused them to be largely replaced by switches in modern networks:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Lack of Intelligence</strong>: Hubs lack the ability to manage data or intelligently direct traffic, leading to inefficient use of network bandwidth.</li>
                    <li><strong>Collisions</strong>: Since hubs operate in a single collision domain, the likelihood of collisions increases with the number of connected devices, leading to network congestion.</li>
                    <li><strong>Security Risks</strong>: All devices connected to the hub receive all network traffic, increasing the risk of eavesdropping or unintended data interception.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bandwidth Limitations</strong>: In a hub, all devices share the available bandwidth. This can severely limit network performance, especially in larger networks.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h4>2.6 Use Cases for Hubs</h4>
                <p>Though largely obsolete today, hubs can still be used in some specific scenarios:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Small Networks</strong>: In small home or office networks where only a few devices are connected, hubs can still function adequately, given the minimal network traffic.</li>
                    <li><strong>Testing and Monitoring</strong>: Hubs can be used in network labs for testing purposes, where broadcasting data to all devices can help monitor network traffic or simulate real-world scenarios.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>

                <p>In a network, hubs are typically used in a <strong>star topology</strong>, where each device is connected to the hub via a separate cable. The hub acts as the central connection point in the star topology.</p>
                <p>This contrasts with a bus topology, where devices are connected along a single cable. In a star topology with a hub, if the hub fails, the entire network can go down, as all devices depend on the hub for communication.</p>

                <h4>2.8 Advantages of Hubs</h4>
                <p>Despite their limitations, hubs offer certain advantages in specific contexts:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Cost-Effective</strong>: Hubs are generally cheaper than switches, making them a cost-effective solution for very small or temporary networks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Simple Setup</strong>: Hubs are easy to set up and require no configuration, making them suitable for users with limited networking knowledge.</li>
                    <li><strong>Legacy Compatibility</strong>: Hubs can still be used in environments where older networking hardware or protocols are in use.</li>

                <h3>3. Switches</h3>
                <p>A switch is a networking device used to connect multiple devices within a Local Area Network (LAN). Operating primarily at the Data Link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model, switches manage and forward data based on MAC (Media Access Control) addresses. Unlike hubs, which broadcast data to all devices, switches send data only to the intended recipient, making them more efficient and secure. Some switches also operate at Layer 3, where they can perform routing functions, combining the capabilities of both switches and routers.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h4>3.1 How Switches Work</h4>
                <p>Switches operate by using a process called packet switching. When data arrives at one of the switch's ports, the switch reads the MAC address in the data frame and compares it to its MAC address table (also called a CAM table) to determine the correct destination. The switch then forwards the data only to the port where the destination device is connected.</p>
                <p>The basic process includes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Learning</strong>: The switch learns the MAC addresses of devices on the network by examining the source MAC address of each incoming frame.</li>
                    <li><strong>Forwarding</strong>: Based on its MAC address table, the switch forwards the data frame to the correct port.</li>
                    <li><strong>Filtering</strong>: If the destination MAC address is on the same port as the source, the switch filters the frame and does not forward it.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h4>3.2 Types of Switches</h4>
                <p>There are several types of switches, each suited for different applications and network sizes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Unmanaged Switches</strong>: Basic switches that require no configuration. These are typically used in small networks and operate as simple plug-and-play devices.</li>
                    <li><strong>Managed Switches</strong>: These switches offer advanced features such as VLAN (Virtual LAN) management, Quality of Service (QoS), and network monitoring. Managed switches are used in larger, enterprise-grade networks where network control is critical.</li>
                    <li><strong>Layer 2 Switches</strong>: Operates at the Data Link layer (Layer 2) and forwards frames based on MAC addresses. Most traditional switches are Layer 2 switches.</li>
                    <li><strong>Layer 3 Switches</strong>: Operates at both the Data Link (Layer 2) and Network layers (Layer 3). These switches can perform routing functions, such as determining the best path for packets based on IP addresses, effectively functioning like a router.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h4>3.3 MAC Address Table</h4>
                <p>The MAC address table is the core data structure that enables switches to forward frames intelligently. Each entry in the table maps a MAC address to a specific port on the switch, allowing the switch to know where to send a particular frame. The table is dynamically updated as the switch learns the MAC addresses of connected devices.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Source MAC Address Learning</strong>: When a frame arrives at the switch, it records the source MAC address and associates it with the port from which it arrived.</li>
                    <li><strong>Destination MAC Address Lookup</strong>: When forwarding a frame, the switch checks the destination MAC address in its table to find the correct output port. If the address is not found, the switch floods the frame to all ports except the one it came from.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h4>3.4 Collision Domains</h4>
                <p>Switches improve network performance by breaking up collision domains. In contrast to hubs, where all devices share the same collision domain, switches create a separate collision domain for each port. This allows devices to communicate simultaneously without collisions, improving network efficiency and reducing retransmissions.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h4>3.5 Broadcast Domains</h4>
                <p>Switches do not, by default, break up broadcast domains. A broadcast domain is a segment of the network where broadcast frames sent by one device are received by all other devices. To divide broadcast domains, VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks) can be used. VLANs logically separate devices into different broadcast domains, even if they are physically connected to the same switch.</p>

                <h4>3.6 Switch Features</h4>
                <p>Modern switches offer a variety of features to improve network performance, management, and security:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>VLANs (Virtual LANs)</strong>: VLANs allow network administrators to logically group devices into different networks, even if they are connected to the same physical switch. This enhances security and traffic management.</li>
                    <li><strong>Link Aggregation</strong>: Allows multiple physical links to be combined into a single logical link, increasing bandwidth and providing redundancy.</li>
                    <li><strong>Port Mirroring</strong>: Sends a copy of network traffic from one or more ports to a specific monitoring port for analysis. This is useful for troubleshooting and security monitoring.</li>
                    <li><strong>Quality of Service (QoS)</strong>: QoS allows the switch to prioritize certain types of traffic, such as voice or video, to ensure smooth and uninterrupted data flow for critical applications.</li>
                    <li><strong>Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)</strong>: Prevents network loops in a Layer 2 network by creating a loop-free logical topology, which is critical in networks with redundant paths.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>3.7 Layer 2 vs. Layer 3 Switches</h4>
                <p>The primary difference between Layer 2 and Layer 3 switches lies in their operational layers:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Layer 2 Switch</strong>: Operates at the Data Link layer, using MAC addresses to forward frames between devices. It is primarily used for local area network (LAN) traffic.</li>
                    <li><strong>Layer 3 Switch</strong>: Adds functionality from the Network layer, enabling it to route packets based on IP addresses. It combines the features of a router with the speed and performance of a switch. Layer 3 switches are used in larger networks that require internal routing between different network segments.</li>
                </ul>

            <article>
                <h4>3.8 Switch Topology</h4>
                <p>Switches are most often deployed in a star topology, where all devices in the network are connected to the switch via individual cables. This central point of connection allows the switch to manage all communication and direct data efficiently to the intended devices.</p>

            <article>
                <h4>3.9 Switch Security Features</h4>
                <p>Switches play a critical role in network security. Key security features include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Port Security</strong>: This feature limits the number of MAC addresses that can connect to a specific port, preventing unauthorized devices from accessing the network.</li>
                    <li><strong>Access Control Lists (ACLs)</strong>: ACLs allow administrators to define rules that control which traffic is allowed or denied based on IP addresses, MAC addresses, or protocols.</li>
                    <li><strong>Storm Control</strong>: Protects against broadcast, multicast, or unicast storms, which can overwhelm network resources.</li>
                    <li><strong>802.1X Authentication</strong>: Ensures that only authenticated users and devices can access the network through the switch.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>3.10 Advantages of Switches</h4>
                <p>Switches provide several advantages over other networking devices like hubs:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Improved Network Efficiency</strong>: By forwarding data only to the intended recipient, switches reduce unnecessary traffic and improve overall network performance.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reduced Collisions</strong>: Each port on a switch represents a separate collision domain, which prevents data collisions and reduces the need for retransmissions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Enhanced Security</strong>: Switches can implement security features like port security, VLANs, and ACLs to prevent unauthorized access and isolate sensitive traffic.</li>
                    <li><strong>Scalability</strong>: Switches can be deployed in large networks and scale efficiently to accommodate growth in the number of devices and traffic volumes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Management and Monitoring</strong>: Managed switches provide extensive control over network traffic, allowing administrators to configure, monitor, and troubleshoot the network more effectively.</li>

                <h3>4. Trunks</h3>
                <p>A trunk is a specialized network link used to carry traffic between switches, routers, or other network devices while supporting multiple VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks). The primary function of a trunk is to transport traffic from different VLANs across a single physical or logical link. Trunking helps manage traffic in complex networks by consolidating multiple VLANs into one interface, reducing the need for separate physical links for each VLAN. Trunking operates at Layer 2 (Data Link Layer) but can also facilitate Layer 3 routing across VLANs.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h4>4.1 VLAN Tagging</h4>
                <p>To distinguish traffic from different VLANs on a trunk link, a process called VLAN tagging is used. VLAN tagging involves adding a header to each frame that identifies the VLAN to which the frame belongs. There are two main standards for VLAN tagging:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>802.1Q</strong>: The IEEE standard for VLAN tagging. It inserts a 4-byte tag into the Ethernet frame header to identify the VLAN.</li>
                    <li><strong>ISL (Inter-Switch Link)</strong>: A Cisco proprietary protocol that encapsulates the frame with VLAN information. It is largely deprecated in favor of 802.1Q.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The tagged frames are transmitted across the trunk, and the receiving device can use the VLAN tag to forward the frame to the appropriate VLAN. Devices that are not VLAN-aware ignore the VLAN tag, while switches and routers can use it to route traffic within and between VLANs.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h4>4.2 Trunk Ports vs. Access Ports</h4>
                <p>Switch ports are typically classified as either trunk ports or access ports, depending on their function:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Trunk Port</strong>: A trunk port carries traffic for multiple VLANs and uses VLAN tagging to distinguish between them. It connects switches to each other or to routers, consolidating traffic from different VLANs over a single link.</li>
                    <li><strong>Access Port</strong>: An access port connects an end device (e.g., computer, printer) to a switch and carries traffic for only one VLAN. Access ports do not use VLAN tagging, as the device connected to the access port is unaware of VLANs.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Trunk ports are typically used for inter-switch communication, whereas access ports are used to connect end devices to a single VLAN.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h4>4.3 How Trunking Works</h4>
                <p>The basic working principle of trunking involves encapsulating Ethernet frames with additional VLAN identification (in the case of 802.1Q). The steps include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The switch tags the frame with the appropriate VLAN ID when forwarding it out of the trunk port.</li>
                    <li>When the frame reaches the receiving switch, the switch reads the VLAN tag and forwards the frame to the appropriate VLAN based on the ID.</li>
                    <li>If the frame is intended for a device on another VLAN, a Layer 3 device (router or Layer 3 switch) may be required to route the traffic between VLANs.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Trunking is essential in multi-VLAN environments, where devices on different VLANs need to communicate without requiring separate physical links for each VLAN.</p>

                <h4>4.4 Configuring Trunks</h4>
                <p>Trunk configuration can vary by vendor, but the following example shows how to configure a trunk link on a Cisco switch:</p>
                <pre><code class=""> # Enable the trunk mode on a switch port Switch(config)# interface gigabitEthernet 0/1 Switch(config-if)# switchport mode trunk
# Allow specific VLANs to pass through the trunk
Switch(config-if)# switchport trunk allowed vlan 10,20,30

# Set the native VLAN (untagged traffic)
Switch(config-if)# switchport trunk native vlan 1 </code></pre>

                <p>In this configuration:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The port is configured as a trunk.</li>
                    <li>Only VLANs 10, 20, and 30 are allowed to pass through the trunk link.</li>
                    <li>The native VLAN is set to VLAN 1, meaning that traffic from VLAN 1 will not be tagged on the trunk.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h4>4.5 Native VLAN and Untagged Frames</h4>
                <p>On a trunk link, the concept of a <strong>native VLAN</strong> comes into play. The native VLAN is the VLAN that does not carry a VLAN tag, meaning frames sent on the native VLAN are transmitted as standard Ethernet frames without a tag. By default, the native VLAN is VLAN 1, but this can be changed based on network design.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Untagged frames arriving on a trunk port are assumed to belong to the native VLAN.</li>
                    <li>Tagging mismatches on the native VLAN can cause security vulnerabilities, such as VLAN hopping attacks.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>4.6 Advantages of Trunking</h4>
                <p>Trunking offers several advantages in a network environment:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Reduced Cable Complexity</strong>: By consolidating multiple VLANs onto a single physical link, trunking reduces the number of cables and ports needed in a network.</li>
                    <li><strong>Improved Scalability</strong>: Trunking allows for easy scalability of VLANs across multiple switches without requiring additional physical connections.</li>
                    <li><strong>Efficient VLAN Communication</strong>: Trunking ensures seamless communication between VLANs, making it easier to manage multi-segment networks.</li>

                <h4>4.7 Use Cases for Trunks</h4>
                <p>Trunks are commonly used in the following network scenarios:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Inter-Switch Communication</strong>: Trunking is essential when multiple switches are used in a network to carry traffic for several VLANs across the same physical link.</li>
                    <li><strong>Switch-to-Router Links</strong>: When connecting a switch to a router for routing between VLANs (also known as a "router-on-a-stick" configuration), a trunk link is used to carry traffic from multiple VLANs to the router.</li>
                    <li><strong>Server-to-Switch Links</strong>: Trunking is used when a server is connected to a switch and participates in multiple VLANs, typically in virtualized environments where virtual machines on the server belong to different VLANs.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>

                <h4>4.8 Security Considerations for Trunks</h4>
                <p>Although trunking is highly efficient, it can also introduce security risks if not configured properly. Common security measures include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>VLAN Pruning</strong>: Only necessary VLANs should be allowed on trunk links to limit the exposure of unnecessary VLANs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Native VLAN Mismatch Protection</strong>: Ensure the native VLAN is consistent across both ends of the trunk to avoid VLAN hopping attacks.</li>
                    <li><strong>802.1X Authentication</strong>: Use 802.1X for port-based network access control, ensuring that only authenticated devices can communicate over trunk links.</li>
                    <li><strong>Disable Unused Ports</strong>: Any trunk ports that are not actively in use should be disabled to prevent unauthorized access.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>5. Firewalls</h3>
                <p>A firewall is a network security device or software that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined security rules. It serves as a barrier between a trusted internal network and an untrusted external network (e.g., the internet), filtering traffic to prevent unauthorized access and cyberattacks. Firewalls play a critical role in protecting networks from malicious threats, ensuring that only legitimate traffic is allowed to pass while blocking potentially harmful data.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>5.1 Functions of a Firewall</h4>
                <p>Firewalls perform several key functions to protect networks:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Traffic Filtering</strong>: Firewalls filter network traffic based on a set of security rules, allowing or denying access based on IP addresses, port numbers, protocols, or other criteria.</li>
                    <li><strong>Access Control</strong>: They control which users or devices can access specific parts of the network, providing role-based access to network resources.</li>
                    <li><strong>Intrusion Prevention</strong>: Modern firewalls can detect and block malicious activity, preventing intrusions and protecting the network from known threats.</li>
                    <li><strong>Logging and Monitoring</strong>: Firewalls log all traffic and can provide insights into network activity, helping administrators detect unusual or suspicious behavior.</li>
                    <li><strong>Virtual Private Network (VPN) Support</strong>: Firewalls often provide VPN functionality to secure remote access to the network by encrypting traffic between the firewall and remote users.</li>

                <h4>5.2 Types of Firewalls</h4>
                <p>Firewalls can be classified into several types based on how they filter traffic and where they are deployed in the network:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Packet-Filtering Firewalls</strong>: These basic firewalls examine packets at the network layer (Layer 3) and decide whether to allow or deny them based on IP addresses, ports, and protocols. They do not inspect the data within the packet.</li>
                    <li><strong>Stateful Inspection Firewalls</strong>: These firewalls track the state of active connections and make decisions based on the state of the connection, not just individual packets. They are more advanced than packet-filtering firewalls and provide better security.</li>
                    <li><strong>Proxy Firewalls</strong>: Acting as an intermediary, proxy firewalls filter traffic at the application layer (Layer 7). They inspect data before passing it between the client and the server, offering deep content inspection for enhanced security.</li>
                    <li><strong>Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFW)</strong>: NGFWs offer advanced features like deep packet inspection, intrusion detection and prevention (IDS/IPS), application control, and threat intelligence. They are designed to detect and block sophisticated threats.</li>
                    <li><strong>Host-Based Firewalls</strong>: These firewalls are installed on individual devices, such as computers or servers, to protect them from unauthorized access. Host-based firewalls work in conjunction with network firewalls for comprehensive security.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cloud Firewalls</strong>: These firewalls are deployed in cloud environments to protect cloud-based resources from external threats. They can be managed as-a-service by cloud providers.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>5.3 Firewall Rules</h4>
                <p>Firewall rules define the conditions under which traffic is allowed or blocked. These rules are based on parameters such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>IP Address</strong>: Firewalls can filter traffic based on the source and destination IP addresses.</li>
                    <li><strong>Port Numbers</strong>: Certain protocols use specific port numbers (e.g., HTTP uses port 80, HTTPS uses port 443). Firewalls can allow or block traffic based on these ports.</li>
                    <li><strong>Protocol</strong>: Traffic can be filtered based on the protocol in use (e.g., TCP, UDP, ICMP).</li>
                    <li><strong>Direction</strong>: Firewalls can apply rules differently for incoming and outgoing traffic, providing granular control over data flow.</li>

                <h4>5.4 Stateful vs. Stateless Firewalls</h4>
                <p>Firewalls can be either stateful or stateless, depending on how they handle network traffic:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Stateless Firewalls</strong>: These firewalls treat each packet independently, without considering the state of the connection. They use simple rules to allow or block traffic based on IP addresses, ports, and protocols. Stateless firewalls are faster but provide less security compared to stateful firewalls.</li>
                    <li><strong>Stateful Firewalls</strong>: These firewalls track the state of network connections and maintain a table of active sessions. They inspect traffic based on the connection's state, providing more context and security. Stateful firewalls are more effective in preventing attacks such as spoofing or session hijacking.</li>

                <h4>6.3 How Access Points Work</h4>
                <p>Access points connect wireless devices to a wired network by providing a radio interface for communication. The basic working of an access point involves:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Wireless devices, like smartphones or laptops, connect to the access point through a wireless signal (Wi-Fi).</li>
                    <li>The AP converts the wireless signal into a wired signal (Ethernet) and forwards the data to the wired portion of the network, such as a switch or router.</li>
                    <li>When data from the wired network is destined for a wireless device, the AP converts it back into a wireless signal and transmits it to the target device.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Access points typically use radio frequencies (2.4 GHz and 5 GHz) to communicate with wireless devices and can support multiple wireless standards like Wi-Fi 4 (802.11n), Wi-Fi 5 (802.11ac), and Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax).</p>
