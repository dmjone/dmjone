				<h3>Network Security: SSL/TLS</h3>
				<p>SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and TLS (Transport Layer Security) are cryptographic protocols that provide secure communication over a network. TLS is the successor to SSL and is more secure. They use encryption to ensure:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Confidentiality:</strong> Data is encrypted to prevent eavesdropping.</li>
					<li><strong>Integrity:</strong> Hashing mechanisms ensure data is not tampered with during transmission.</li>
					<li><strong>Authentication:</strong> Digital certificates validate the server and, optionally, the client.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>The handshake process in SSL/TLS establishes a secure session using asymmetric encryption (RSA, ECC) and then switches to faster symmetric encryption (AES) for data transfer.</p>
			</article>
			
			<article>
				<h3>Network Security: ARP</h3>
				<p>ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) resolves IPv4 addresses to MAC addresses within a local network. It is essential for devices to communicate at the data link layer. ARP operates as follows:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Request:</strong> A device broadcasts an ARP request to find the MAC address of a given IP.</li>
					<li><strong>Reply:</strong> The device with the matching IP responds with its MAC address.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>However, ARP is vulnerable to spoofing attacks, where an attacker sends forged ARP messages to associate their MAC address with a target's IP, potentially leading to man-in-the-middle attacks.</p>
			</article>
			
			<article>
				<h3>Sliding Window Protocol</h3>
				<p>The Sliding Window Protocol ensures reliable data transmission in TCP. It uses a window to control the flow of data and manage congestion. Key concepts:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Sender Window:</strong> Limits the number of unacknowledged packets the sender can transmit.</li>
					<li><strong>Receiver Window:</strong> Indicates how much data the receiver can handle.</li>
					<li><strong>Acknowledgments:</strong> The receiver sends ACKs for received packets, allowing the sender to slide the window forward.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>This protocol improves efficiency by allowing continuous transmission of packets without waiting for individual acknowledgments, reducing idle time.</p>
			</article>

			<article>
				<h3>Why IP Addresses Are Used Instead of MAC Addresses for Data Transmission</h3>
				<p>While MAC addresses are unique to every hardware and used at the data link layer, IP addresses are essential for the following reasons:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Scalability:</strong> MAC addresses work only within a local network (LAN). IP addresses provide a hierarchical addressing scheme, enabling routing across vast, interconnected networks (WAN, Internet).</li>
					<li><strong>Global Reach:</strong> Routers operate at the network layer and cannot interpret MAC addresses. IP addresses are used to route data between different networks.</li>
					<li><strong>Logical Addressing:</strong> IP addresses allow dynamic assignment and logical grouping of devices, whereas MAC addresses are fixed and tied to hardware.</li>
					<li><strong>Network Segmentation:</strong> IP addresses enable subnetting and efficient traffic management, which is not possible with flat MAC address schemes.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Therefore, IP addresses are necessary for routing and managing data across multiple networks, while MAC addresses function only within a single local network.</p>
