                <h3>1. TFTP/FTP in the Network</h3>
                <p>Both TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol) and FTP (File Transfer Protocol) are protocols used to transfer files between systems in a network. They play a crucial role in various network operations, especially for managing files, firmware, and configuration settings.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>1.1 FTP (File Transfer Protocol)</h4>
                <p>FTP is a standard protocol used to transfer files between a client and a server on a network. It operates over TCP and is used for reliable file exchange.</p>
                <h5>1.1.1 Key Features of FTP</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Connection-Oriented</strong>: FTP uses TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) to establish a reliable connection between the client and server.</li>
                    <li><strong>Authentication</strong>: FTP supports user authentication, often requiring a username and password for access.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Transmission</strong>: FTP transfers data in two modes—ASCII (for text files) and Binary (for non-text files).</li>
                    <li><strong>Active and Passive Modes</strong>: In active mode, the client opens a random port for data transfer. In passive mode, the server opens a random port and waits for the client to connect.</li>
                </ul>
                <h5>1.1.2 How FTP Works</h5>
                <p>FTP works using two channels: a command channel for sending commands and a data channel for transferring data. When a client connects to an FTP server, the following occurs:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The client sends a request to establish a connection to the server's control port (default 21).</li>
                    <li>The client logs in with credentials.</li>
                    <li>File transfer commands are sent through the control channel.</li>
                    <li>The server initiates a separate connection on a data port (default 20) for file transfers.</li>
                </ol>                
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>1.2 TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol)</h4>
                <p>TFTP is a simplified version of FTP, primarily used for transferring small amounts of data, such as boot files and configuration settings in network devices. Unlike FTP, TFTP operates over UDP and does not require user authentication.</p>
                <h5>1.2.1 Key Features of TFTP</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Connectionless</strong>: TFTP uses UDP (User Datagram Protocol), which does not establish a reliable connection. As a result, it is less reliable than FTP but faster for small transfers.</li>
                    <li><strong>No Authentication</strong>: TFTP does not support authentication, making it insecure for public file transfers but useful in controlled environments.</li>
                    <li><strong>Limited Functionality</strong>: TFTP can only perform basic file transfers and lacks advanced features like directory listing or file renaming.</li>
                </ul>
                <h5>1.2.2 How TFTP Works</h5>
                <p>TFTP uses UDP port 69 for file transfer. The process works as follows:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The client sends a read or write request to the TFTP server.</li>
                    <li>The server sends an acknowledgment (ACK) to the client for each block of data sent.</li>
                    <li>The client and server exchange data in small blocks (usually 512 bytes) until the file transfer is complete.</li>
                </ol>
            </article>

                <h4>1.3 Differences Between FTP and TFTP</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Transport Protocol</strong>: FTP uses TCP (reliable), while TFTP uses UDP (unreliable but faster).</li>
                    <li><strong>Security</strong>: FTP supports authentication and encryption, while TFTP has no built-in security mechanisms.</li>
                    <li><strong>Use Cases</strong>: FTP is used for large and secure file transfers. TFTP is mainly used for device configuration and boot file transfers.</li>
                </ul>
