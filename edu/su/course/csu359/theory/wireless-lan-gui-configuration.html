                <h3>3. QoS Profiles</h3>
                <p>Quality of Service (QoS) profiles are used in WLAN configuration to prioritize certain types of network traffic, ensuring that critical applications such as voice, video, or gaming receive the necessary bandwidth and lower latency for optimal performance. Without QoS, all data packets are treated equally, which can lead to performance issues for high-priority applications.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h4>3.1 Key Concepts of QoS</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Traffic Prioritization</strong>: QoS allows you to assign higher priority to specific types of traffic, such as voice, video, or business-critical applications.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bandwidth Allocation</strong>: Allocates minimum or maximum bandwidth for specific services, preventing lower-priority traffic from monopolizing network resources.</li>
                    <li><strong>Latency Reduction</strong>: Ensures time-sensitive applications (e.g., voice over IP) experience minimal delay, improving user experience.</li>
                </ul>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h4>3.2 Types of QoS Profiles</h4>
                <p>Different types of QoS profiles can be configured based on the specific needs of the network traffic. These include profiles for voice, video, and best-effort data traffic.</p>

                <article>
                    <h5>3.2.1 Voice QoS Profile</h5>
                    <p>This profile prioritizes voice traffic to ensure smooth VoIP communication, reducing latency and jitter. Key parameters include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Low Latency</strong>: Ensures minimal delay for real-time communication.</li>
                        <li><strong>High Priority</strong>: Assigns a higher priority to voice packets over other types of traffic.</li>
