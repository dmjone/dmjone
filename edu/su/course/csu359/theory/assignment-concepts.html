        <h3>1. What is a Computer Network?</h3>
        <p>A <strong>computer network</strong> is a system of interconnected computers and devices that communicate with each other to share data, resources, and services. The communication occurs through a combination of hardware (like routers, switches, and cables) and software (network protocols).</p>

        <p>Devices in a network can include computers, servers, mobile phones, printers, and other peripherals.</p>


        <article>
          <h4>1.1 Main Goals of a Computer Network</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Resource Sharing</strong>: Allows sharing of hardware (e.g., printers, storage devices) and software (e.g., applications) among multiple users. This reduces cost and maximizes utilization.</li>
            <li><strong>Communication</strong>: Facilitates communication between users through emails, messaging, video calls, and file sharing, enabling collaboration over long distances.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Sharing</strong>: Enables easy and fast transfer of data and files between connected devices, improving efficiency.</li>
            <li><strong>Scalability</strong>: Supports adding new devices or users without disrupting the existing system, allowing the network to grow as required.</li>
            <li><strong>Reliability</strong>: Provides alternative paths for data transfer (redundancy), ensuring uninterrupted services even if one path fails.</li>
          </ul>
        </article>

        <article>
          <h5>1.1.1 Example</h5>
          <p>In a school network, computers are connected to a single printer. Students send print jobs from their devices (resource sharing) and access common files stored on a central server (data sharing). Teachers use emails and messaging apps to communicate with students (communication).</p>

        <h3>2. Define the terms: IP Address, MAC Address, and Port Number</h3>

        <article>
          <h4>2.1 IP Address</h4>
          <p>An <strong>IP Address (Internet Protocol Address)</strong> is a unique numerical label assigned to each device connected to a network. It identifies the device and its location on the network, enabling communication between devices.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Types</strong>: IPv4 (32-bit, e.g., 192.168.1.1), IPv6 (128-bit, e.g., 2001:0db8::1).</li>
            <li><strong>Example</strong>: A computer connected to a home network may have the IP address <code>192.168.1.10</code>.</li>
          </ul>
        </article>
        <article>
          <h4>2.2 MAC Address</h4>
          <p>A <strong>MAC Address (Media Access Control Address)</strong> is a unique hardware identifier assigned to the Network Interface Card (NIC) of a device. It is a 48-bit address written in hexadecimal format.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Format</strong>: Six pairs of hexadecimal digits separated by colons or hyphens.</li>
            <li><strong>Purpose</strong>: Ensures unique identification of hardware devices on a local network.</li>
            <li><strong>Example</strong>: <code>00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E</code>.</li>
          </ul>
        </article>
        <article>
          <h4>2.3 Port Number</h4>
          <p>A <strong>Port Number</strong> is a numerical identifier used in networking to specify the application or process for data communication within a device. It helps differentiate between multiple services running on the same IP address.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Range</strong>: 0–65535.</li>
            <li><strong>Well-known Ports</strong>:
              <ul>
                <li>HTTP: Port 80</li>
                <li>HTTPS: Port 443</li>
                <li>FTP: Port 21</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Example</strong>: For accessing a website using HTTPS, the communication uses IP <code>192.168.1.10</code> and Port <code>443</code>.</li>
          </ul>

        <h3>10. What is DHCP?</h3>
        <p><strong>DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)</strong> is a network protocol used to automatically assign IP addresses and other network configuration settings (e.g., subnet mask, gateway, DNS server) to devices on a network.</p>

        <p>DHCP operates on a client-server model, where a DHCP server dynamically allocates IP addresses to DHCP clients.</p>


        <article>
          <h4>10.1 Why is DHCP Important in Networking?</h4>
          <p>DHCP is critical for efficient and seamless network management due to the following reasons:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Automatic IP Configuration</strong>: DHCP eliminates the need for manual IP address assignment, reducing errors and administrative workload.</li>
            <li><strong>Efficient IP Address Management</strong>: It dynamically assigns IP addresses, preventing address conflicts and reusing IPs efficiently.</li>
            <li><strong>Centralized Control</strong>: A DHCP server manages all IP addresses, simplifying network administration.</li>
            <li><strong>Scalability</strong>: DHCP is ideal for large networks where assigning IPs manually is impractical.</li>
            <li><strong>Consistency</strong>: Ensures devices receive the correct network configurations (e.g., default gateway, DNS server).</li>
          </ul>
        </article>

        <article>
          <h4>10.2 How DHCP Works</h4>
          <p>DHCP works in four steps, known as the <strong>DORA process</strong>:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Discovery</strong>: The client broadcasts a DHCP discovery message to locate a DHCP server.</li>
            <li><strong>Offer</strong>: The DHCP server responds with an offer containing an available IP address and configuration details.</li>
            <li><strong>Request</strong>: The client sends a request to accept the offered IP address.</li>
            <li><strong>Acknowledgment</strong>: The DHCP server sends an acknowledgment, confirming the IP assignment.</li>
          </ol>

          <h5>Example</h5>
          <p>When a laptop connects to a Wi-Fi network, the DHCP server assigns it an IP address like <code>192.168.1.10</code> automatically, along with other configurations such as the gateway and DNS server.</p>

        <h3>13. What is a Subnet Mask?</h3>
        <p>A <strong>subnet mask</strong> is a 32-bit number used in IP addressing to divide an IP address into two parts:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Network Portion</strong>: Identifies the network to which the IP address belongs.</li>
          <li><strong>Host Portion</strong>: Identifies specific devices (hosts) within that network.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The subnet mask helps determine the network boundaries and facilitates efficient IP address allocation.</p>


        <article>
          <h4>13.1 How Subnet Mask Works</h4>
          <p>In IPv4, an IP address is split into <strong>network bits</strong> and <strong>host bits</strong> using the subnet mask.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The subnet mask consists of a sequence of <strong>1s</strong> followed by <strong>0s</strong> (e.g., <code>255.255.255.0</code>).</li>
            <li><strong>1s</strong> in the subnet mask represent the <strong>network portion</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>0s</strong> represent the <strong>host portion</strong>.</li>
          </ul>

          <h5>Example:</h5>
          <p>Consider the IP address <code>192.168.1.10</code> with a subnet mask <code>255.255.255.0</code>:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Subnet Mask in binary: <code>11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000</code>.</li>
            <li><strong>Network Portion</strong>: The first 24 bits (<code>192.168.1</code>).</li>
            <li><strong>Host Portion</strong>: The last 8 bits (<code>10</code>).</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This means all devices with IP addresses <code>192.168.1.1</code> to <code>192.168.1.254</code> are part of the same network.</p>

          <h5>Diagram:</h5>
          <pre><code>
        IP Address:   192.168.1.10 → 11000000.10101000.00000001.00001010  
        Subnet Mask:  255.255.255.0 → 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000  
        Network ID:   192.168.1.0   → 11000000.10101000.00000001.00000000

        <h3>14. Define the Term Bandwidth</h3>
        <p><strong>Bandwidth</strong> refers to the maximum amount of data that can be transmitted over a network connection in a given amount of time. It is measured in bits per second (bps), commonly expressed in Mbps (Megabits per second) or Gbps (Gigabits per second).</p>

        <p>Bandwidth represents the <strong>capacity</strong> of a communication link.</p>

        <h3>15. What is Latency in Networking?</h3>
        <p><strong>Latency</strong> in networking refers to the time delay experienced when data travels from the source to the destination across a network. It is measured in milliseconds (ms).</p>

        <p>Latency includes the total time taken for:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Data transmission</li>
          <li>Processing at routers and switches</li>
          <li>Propagation over the network</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Types of Latency:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Propagation Delay</strong>: Time for a signal to travel through the medium.</li>
          <li><strong>Transmission Delay</strong>: Time taken to place the data onto the medium.</li>
          <li><strong>Processing Delay</strong>: Time for routers/switches to process and forward the data.</li>
          <li><strong>Queuing Delay</strong>: Time spent waiting in queues at routers or switches due to congestion.</li>
        </ul>
        <article>
          <h4>15.1 How Does Latency Impact Communication?</h4>
          <p>High latency negatively affects communication in the following ways:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Slower Data Transfer</strong>: Increased delay in sending and receiving data packets.</li>
            <li><strong>Poor User Experience</strong>: Delays in real-time applications like video calls, online gaming, and live streaming.</li>
            <li><strong>Decreased Network Efficiency</strong>: High latency can cause packet retransmissions in protocols like TCP, further reducing network performance.</li>
            <li><strong>Impact on Critical Applications</strong>: Applications requiring low latency, such as financial transactions and IoT systems, suffer from delays.</li>
          </ul>

          <h5>Example:</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>In online gaming, high latency (e.g., 200 ms) causes "lag," where player actions take longer to register.</li>
            <li>In video conferencing, latency causes audio and video desynchronization, disrupting communication.</li>
          </ul>
        </article>

        <article>
          <h4>15.2 Summary of Latency Impact</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Low latency (<strong>ideal</strong>) ensures smooth communication and real-time interactions.</li>
            <li>High latency (<strong>undesirable</strong>) causes delays, lag, and reduced system performance.</li>
          </ul>

          <h5>Latency Analogy:</h5>
          <p>Latency is like the time it takes for a letter to travel through the postal system: the longer the delay, the slower the communication.</p>

          <h4>18.2 Role of a Modem in Connecting to the Internet</h4>
          <p>The modem serves as a <strong>gateway</strong> to connect a local network or individual device to the Internet Service Provider (ISP). Its roles include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Signal Conversion</strong>: Bridges the gap between digital devices and analog communication lines.</li>
            <li><strong>Enabling Internet Access</strong>: Connects the home or office network to the ISP for Internet access.</li>
            <li><strong>Communication Over Various Mediums</strong>:
              <ul>
                <li>DSL Modems: Use telephone lines.</li>
                <li>Cable Modems: Use coaxial cables (common in broadband connections).</li>
                <li>Fiber Optic Modems: Use optical fibers for high-speed connections.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h5>Example:</h5>
          <p>In a home network:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The modem connects to the ISP via a telephone or cable line.</li>
            <li>The router (or computer) connects to the modem to access the Internet.</li>
          </ul>

        <h3>19. What is a Load Balancer?</h3>
        <p>A <strong>load balancer</strong> is a networking device or software that distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers or resources. It ensures no single server becomes overwhelmed, thereby improving performance, availability, and reliability.</p>

        <p>Load balancers are commonly used in large-scale networks, data centers, and cloud environments.</p>

        <article>
          <h4>19.1 How a Load Balancer Works</h4>
          <p>When a client sends a request to access a service (e.g., a website), the load balancer:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Receives the incoming request.</li>
            <li>Decides which server (or resource) will handle the request based on preconfigured algorithms.</li>
            <li>Forwards the request to the chosen server.</li>
            <li>Returns the server's response to the client transparently.</li>
          </ol>

          <p>This process ensures efficient utilization of servers and minimizes downtime.</p>
        </article>

        <article>
          <h4>19.2 Types of Load Balancers</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Hardware Load Balancer</strong>: A physical device that distributes traffic at high speeds.</li>
            <li><strong>Software Load Balancer</strong>: Software-based, running on standard servers (e.g., NGINX, HAProxy).</li>
            <li><strong>Cloud Load Balancer</strong>: Provided by cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud.</li>
          </ul>
        </article>

        <article>
          <h4>19.3 Load Balancing Algorithms</h4>
          <p>Load balancers use algorithms to decide how to distribute traffic:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Round Robin</strong>: Sends requests to servers in a sequential order.</li>
            <li><strong>Least Connections</strong>: Directs traffic to the server with the fewest active connections.</li>
            <li><strong>IP Hash</strong>: Uses the client's IP address to determine which server will handle the request.</li>
            <li><strong>Weighted Round Robin</strong>: Assigns priority based on server capacity.</li>
          </ul>
        </article>

        <article>
          <h4>19.4 Role of a Load Balancer in Networks</h4>
          <p>A load balancer plays a critical role in network infrastructure by:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Improving Performance</strong>: Distributes workloads evenly, reducing server response times.</li>
            <li><strong>Ensuring High Availability</strong>: Redirects traffic to available servers when one fails, minimizing downtime.</li>
            <li><strong>Scalability</strong>: Allows new servers to be added seamlessly as demand increases.</li>
            <li><strong>Enhanced Security</strong>: Protects servers by acting as a single entry point, allowing security features like SSL termination and DDoS mitigation.</li>
          </ul>
        </article>

        <article>
          <h4>19.5 Example</h4>
          <p>In a large e-commerce website:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A load balancer distributes customer requests to multiple web servers.</li>
            <li>If one server goes offline, the load balancer reroutes traffic to healthy servers, ensuring uninterrupted access.</li>
          </ul>

        <h3>22. What is a VPN?</h3>
        <p>A <strong>VPN (Virtual Private Network)</strong> is a technology that creates a secure, encrypted connection over a public or private network, such as the Internet. It allows users to send and receive data as if their devices were directly connected to a private network.</p>

        <article>
          <h4>22.1 How VPN Works</h4>
          <p>A VPN establishes a <strong>tunnel</strong> between the user’s device and a VPN server. All data transmitted through the tunnel is encrypted, ensuring privacy and security.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>The user connects to a VPN client on their device.</li>
            <li>The VPN client encrypts the data and sends it to the VPN server.</li>
            <li>The VPN server decrypts the data and forwards it to the destination (e.g., a website).</li>
            <li>Responses from the destination are encrypted and sent back through the VPN server to the user.</li>
          </ol>

          <p>As a result, third parties cannot intercept or read the data.</p>
        </article>
        <article>
          <h4>22.2 Importance of VPN in Network Security</h4>
          <p>VPNs play a crucial role in maintaining security and privacy in modern networks:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Data Encryption</strong>: Encrypts data transmissions, protecting sensitive information from eavesdropping and hackers.</li>
            <li><strong>Privacy</strong>: Masks the user's IP address, ensuring anonymity while browsing the Internet.</li>
            <li><strong>Secure Remote Access</strong>: Allows employees to securely access company resources over the Internet, critical for remote work.</li>
            <li><strong>Bypassing Geo-Restrictions</strong>: Provides access to restricted content or websites by routing traffic through servers in other regions.</li>

        <h3>23. What are DoS and DDoS Attacks?</h3>
        <p>Both <strong>DoS (Denial of Service)</strong> and <strong>DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service)</strong> attacks aim to disrupt network services, making them unavailable to legitimate users by overwhelming a server or network with excessive traffic.</p>
        <article>
          <h4>23.1 DoS (Denial of Service) Attack</h4>
          <p>A <strong>DoS attack</strong> is launched from a single machine to flood a target (server, network, or website) with malicious requests or traffic, causing system overload or crash.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Characteristics</strong>: Single-source attack.</li>
            <li><strong>Example</strong>: Sending a massive number of ping requests (ICMP flood) to a server, consuming its resources.</li>
          </ul>
        </article>
        <article>
          <h4>23.2 DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) Attack</h4>
          <p>A <strong>DDoS attack</strong> involves multiple compromised systems (botnets) simultaneously sending traffic to overwhelm a target. It is more severe and harder to mitigate than a DoS attack.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Characteristics</strong>: Multi-source attack; uses a network of infected devices (botnets).</li>
            <li><strong>Example</strong>: Coordinated traffic overload from thousands of devices to a website.</li>
          </ul>

        <article>
          <h4>23.3 How Networks Can Defend Against DoS and DDoS Attacks</h4>
          <p>Networks can implement the following strategies to mitigate and defend against these attacks:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Traffic Filtering</strong>: Use firewalls and intrusion detection systems (IDS) to filter and block malicious traffic.</li>
            <li><strong>Rate Limiting</strong>: Limit the number of requests a server accepts per second to prevent resource exhaustion.</li>
            <li><strong>Load Balancing</strong>: Distribute traffic across multiple servers to reduce the impact of excessive requests.</li>
            <li><strong>Blackholing</strong>: Route malicious traffic to a "black hole" where it is dropped and discarded.</li>
            <li><strong>CDN (Content Delivery Network)</strong>: Use CDNs to absorb traffic and distribute it across multiple servers, reducing the load on a single server.</li>
            <li><strong>IP Blocking</strong>: Identify and block IP addresses sending malicious requests.</li>
            <li><strong>Use DDoS Protection Services</strong>: Services like Cloudflare, AWS Shield, or Akamai provide dedicated protection against DDoS attacks.</li>
          </ul>

        <h3>25. Concept of SSL/TLS in Securing Data Transmission</h3>
        <p><strong>SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)</strong> and <strong>TLS (Transport Layer Security)</strong> are cryptographic protocols used to secure data transmission over a network. They provide encryption, authentication, and data integrity, ensuring secure communication between a client and server.</p>

        <p><strong>SSL</strong> was the original protocol, but it has been replaced by the more secure <strong>TLS</strong>. Despite this, the term "SSL" is still widely used to refer to both protocols.</p>

        <article>
          <h4>25.1 How SSL/TLS Works</h4>
          <p>SSL/TLS secures data transmission through the following steps:</p>

          <ol>
            <li><strong>Handshake Process</strong>:
              <ul>
                <li>The client (e.g., a browser) sends a request to connect to the server securely.</li>
                <li>The server responds with its <strong>digital certificate</strong> containing its public key.</li>
                <li>The client verifies the certificate's authenticity using a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).</li>
              </ul>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Session Key Generation</strong>:
              <ul>
                <li>The client and server agree on a <strong>session key</strong> for symmetric encryption, ensuring data confidentiality.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Data Encryption and Transmission</strong>:
              <ul>
                <li>All data transmitted between the client and server is encrypted using the session key.</li>
                <li>This prevents third parties from intercepting or tampering with the data.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h5>Diagram:</h5>
          <pre><code>
Client (Browser) → SSL/TLS Handshake → Server

          <h4>25.2 Key Features of SSL/TLS</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Encryption</strong>: Encrypts data to ensure it cannot be read by unauthorized parties.</li>
            <li><strong>Authentication</strong>: Verifies the identity of the server (and optionally the client) using digital certificates.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Integrity</strong>: Ensures data is not tampered with during transmission using cryptographic hashes.</li>
          </ul>
        </article>

        <article>
          <h4>25.3 Importance of SSL/TLS</h4>
          <p>SSL/TLS is essential for:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Secure Web Browsing</strong>: Used in HTTPS to secure websites.</li>
            <li><strong>Preventing Eavesdropping</strong>: Protects sensitive data, such as login credentials and payment information.</li>
            <li><strong>Ensuring Trust</strong>: Websites with valid SSL certificates show a padlock icon in browsers, indicating secure connections.</li>
          </ul>

          <h5>Example:</h5>
          <p>When a user visits a secure website like <code>https://example.com</code>, SSL/TLS encrypts their data (e.g., passwords, credit card details) to protect it from interception.</p>

        <h3>26. What is NAT (Network Address Translation)?</h3>
        <p><strong>Network Address Translation (NAT)</strong> is a method used in networking to translate private IP addresses within a local network to a single public IP address (or multiple public IPs) for communication with external networks like the Internet.</p>

        <p>NAT operates on a router or firewall, acting as an intermediary between the local network and the Internet.</p>

        <article>
          <h4>26.1 Why is NAT Used?</h4>
          <p>NAT is primarily used for the following purposes:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>IP Address Conservation</strong>:
              <p>With the limited number of IPv4 public addresses, NAT allows multiple devices in a local network to share a single public IP address.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Improved Security</strong>:
              <p>Devices with private IP addresses are hidden from the Internet, reducing exposure to attacks.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Seamless Private Network Communication</strong>:
              <p>Enables devices within a local network to communicate while still accessing external networks.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </article>

        <article>
          <h4>26.2 How NAT Works</h4>
          <p>NAT maps private IP addresses in the local network to a public IP address when sending data to external networks. When responses are received, NAT translates the public IP back to the private IP.</p>

          <h5>Steps:</h5>
          <ol>
            <li>A device with a private IP (e.g., <code>192.168.1.10</code>) sends a request to the Internet.</li>
            <li>The NAT-enabled router replaces the private IP with its public IP (e.g., <code>203.0.113.5</code>).</li>
            <li>When the response arrives, the router maps it back to the original private IP and forwards it to the requesting device.</li>
          </ol>

          <h5>Diagram:</h5>
          <pre><code>
Private Network         NAT Router            Internet
192.168.1.10  → 203.0.113.5  →  Destination Server
                (NAT Translation)
</code></pre>
        </article>

        <article>
          <h4>26.3 Types of NAT</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Static NAT</strong>: Maps a single private IP address to a single public IP address.</li>
            <li><strong>Dynamic NAT</strong>: Maps a private IP address to one of many public IP addresses dynamically.</li>
            <li><strong>Port Address Translation (PAT)</strong>: Also called <strong>NAT Overloading</strong>, it maps multiple private IPs to a single public IP using unique port numbers.</li>
          </ul>

          <h5>Example of PAT:</h5>
          <pre><code>
192.168.1.10:12345 → 203.0.113.5:5000  
192.168.1.11:12346 → 203.0.113.5:5001
</code></pre>

          <p>Both private IPs share the same public IP but use different port numbers.</p>

          <h4>26.4 Advantages of NAT</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>IP Address Conservation</strong>: Reduces the need for public IP addresses.</li>
            <li><strong>Enhanced Security</strong>: Hides private IP addresses from external networks.</li>
            <li><strong>Flexibility</strong>: Allows easy addition of new devices within the local network.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>26.5 Limitations of NAT</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Can introduce delays due to address translation.</li>
            <li>Incompatible with some applications requiring end-to-end IP visibility (e.g., certain VoIP or P2P services).</li>
          </ul>

        <h3>28. Role of DNS in the Internet</h3>
        <p>The <strong>Domain Name System (DNS)</strong> is a fundamental component of the Internet that translates human-readable domain names (e.g., <code>www.example.com</code>) into machine-readable IP addresses (e.g., <code>192.168.1.1</code>).</p>

        <p>DNS acts as the Internet's "phonebook," allowing users to access websites and services without remembering complex IP addresses.</p>

        <article>
          <h4>28.1 Why DNS is Important</h4>
          <p>DNS plays a crucial role in enabling seamless communication and access to resources on the Internet:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Name-to-IP Resolution</strong>: DNS resolves domain names into IP addresses so devices can locate servers.</li>
            <li><strong>Ease of Use</strong>: Users can type friendly names (e.g., <code>google.com</code>) instead of numeric IP addresses.</li>
            <li><strong>Load Balancing</strong>: DNS can direct traffic to multiple servers, ensuring reliability and improved performance.</li>
            <li><strong>Redundancy</strong>: DNS operates in a distributed manner, ensuring fault tolerance and high availability.</li>
            <li><strong>Service Lookup</strong>: DNS supports services like email by mapping domain names to mail servers (MX records).</li>
          </ul>
        </article>

        <article>
          <h4>28.2 How DNS Works</h4>
          <p>DNS operates through a series of steps to resolve a domain name to an IP address:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>User Request</strong>: The user enters a domain name (e.g., <code>www.example.com</code>) in a browser.</li>
            <li><strong>Local DNS Query</strong>: The browser sends the request to the <strong>Local DNS Server</strong> (provided by the ISP).</li>
            <li><strong>Recursive Query</strong>: If the IP address is not cached locally, the request is forwarded to root DNS servers, then to TLD (Top-Level Domain) servers, and finally to the authoritative DNS server for the domain.</li>
            <li><strong>IP Resolution</strong>: The authoritative DNS server returns the corresponding IP address (e.g., <code>93.184.216.34</code>).</li>
            <li><strong>Response to User</strong>: The local DNS server caches the result and sends it back to the user's browser, which establishes a connection to the target server.</li>
          </ol>

          <h5>Diagram:</h5>
          <pre><code>
User → Local DNS → Root DNS → TLD DNS → Authoritative DNS → IP Address Returned
</code></pre>
        </article>

        <article>
          <h4>28.3 DNS Components</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Root DNS Servers</strong>: Direct queries to the appropriate Top-Level Domain (TLD) servers.</li>
            <li><strong>TLD Servers</strong>: Handle queries for specific domains like <code>.com</code>, <code>.org</code>, or <code>.net</code>.</li>
            <li><strong>Authoritative DNS Servers</strong>: Store and provide the IP address for a specific domain.</li>
            <li><strong>Resolver</strong>: A DNS client that performs the name resolution process.</li>

          <p>QoS manages network traffic based on the following key metrics:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Bandwidth</strong>: The maximum capacity of data transfer in a network.</li>
            <li><strong>Latency</strong>: The time taken for data to travel from source to destination.</li>
            <li><strong>Jitter</strong>: Variation in packet delays, which affects real-time communication.</li>
            <li><strong>Packet Loss</strong>: Dropping of packets due to congestion or errors.</li>
          </ul>
        </article>

        <article>
          <h4>29.3 How QoS Works</h4>
          <p>QoS works by classifying, prioritizing, and managing network traffic:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Traffic Classification</strong>: Network traffic is classified into categories (e.g., voice, video, web traffic).</li>
            <li><strong>Traffic Prioritization</strong>: Higher-priority traffic (e.g., VoIP) is given precedence over lower-priority traffic (e.g., email).</li>
            <li><strong>Resource Allocation</strong>: Bandwidth is allocated based on the priority and needs of each traffic type.</li>
            <li><strong>Traffic Shaping</strong>: Limits the data rate for non-critical traffic to prevent congestion.</li>
          </ol>
        </article>

        <article>
          <h4>29.4 Techniques for Implementing QoS</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Prioritization</strong>: Assigning traffic priorities using techniques like Class of Service (CoS) or Differentiated Services (DiffServ).</li>
            <li><strong>Bandwidth Reservation</strong>: Reserving bandwidth for critical applications using protocols like RSVP (Resource Reservation Protocol).</li>
            <li><strong>Traffic Shaping</strong>: Regulating data flow to prevent excessive use of bandwidth.</li>
            <li><strong>Queuing Mechanisms</strong>: Using methods like FIFO (First In, First Out), WFQ (Weighted Fair Queuing), or priority queuing to manage traffic.</li>
          </ul>
        </article>

        <article>
          <h4>29.5 Example of QoS</h4>
          <p>In a corporate network:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Video conferencing (real-time application) is given high priority to reduce latency and jitter.</li>
            <li>Background traffic, such as file downloads or email, is assigned lower priority to prevent bandwidth hogging.</li>
          </ul>

        <h3>31. Steps to Troubleshoot a Network That Is Not Connecting to the Internet</h3>
        <p>When a network is not connecting to the Internet, systematic troubleshooting helps identify and resolve the issue. The following steps can be followed:</p>

        <article>
          <h4>31.1 Step-by-Step Troubleshooting Process</h4>

          <h5>Step 1: Verify Physical Connections</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>Check if all cables (Ethernet, power) are securely connected to the modem, router, and computer.</li>
            <li>Ensure the network devices are powered on (lights blinking).</li>
            <li><strong>Example</strong>: A loose Ethernet cable can prevent connectivity.</li>
          </ul>

          <h5>Step 2: Check Device Connectivity</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>Ensure the computer or device is connected to the correct Wi-Fi network or LAN.</li>
            <li>Check for Wi-Fi signal strength or Ethernet link status.</li>
            <li>Use the <strong>ping</strong> command to test local connectivity:
              <pre><code>
ping 192.168.1.1
</code></pre>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h5>Step 3: Test Internet Access on Another Device</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>Connect another device (e.g., smartphone, laptop) to the same network.</li>

          <h5>Step 4: Restart Network Devices</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>Power cycle the modem and router:</li>
            <ol>
              <li>Turn off the modem and router.</li>
              <li>Wait 30 seconds and turn them back on.</li>
            </ol>
            <li>This clears temporary issues with the network equipment.</li>
          </ul>

          <h5>Step 5: Check IP Configuration</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>Verify the device has a valid IP address using the following command:</li>
            <pre><code>
ipconfig (Windows) / ifconfig (Linux/Mac)
</code></pre>
            <li>If the IP address is <code>169.x.x.x</code>, it indicates a DHCP issue.</li>
            <li>Renew the IP address:
              <pre><code>
ipconfig /release
ipconfig /renew
</code></pre>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h5>Step 6: Test DNS Resolution</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>Check if the DNS server is resolving domain names correctly:</li>
            <pre><code>
ping 8.8.8.8 (Google's public DNS server)
</code></pre>
            <li>If this works, try resolving a domain name:</li>
            <pre><code>
ping www.google.com
</code></pre>
            <li>If domain resolution fails, configure a public DNS server (e.g., 8.8.8.8).</li>
          </ul>

          <h5>Step 7: Check Firewall and Antivirus Settings</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>Ensure firewalls or antivirus software are not blocking Internet access.</li>
            <li>Temporarily disable them to test connectivity.</li>
          </ul>

          <h5>Step 8: Inspect Router and Modem</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>Log in to the router's configuration page (e.g., <code>192.168.1.1</code>).</li>
            <li>Check for Internet status, WAN IP, and connectivity logs.</li>
            <li>If no WAN IP is assigned, contact the ISP.</li>
          </ul>

          <h5>Step 9: Test ISP Connection</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>If the above steps fail, contact the Internet Service Provider (ISP).</li>
            <li>The issue could be with the ISP or an outage in the area.</li>

        <h3>32. Resolving an IP Address Conflict in a Network</h3>
        <p>An <strong>IP address conflict</strong> occurs when two or more devices on the same network are assigned the same IP address, leading to connectivity issues. This can happen in both static and dynamic IP addressing setups.</p>

        <article>
          <h4>32.1 Steps to Resolve an IP Address Conflict</h4>

          <h5>Step 1: Identify the Conflicting Devices</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>Look for the devices displaying IP conflict error messages.</li>
            <li>Use the <code>arp -a</code> command to identify devices using the same IP address.</li>
            <pre><code>
arp -a
</code></pre>
            <li>Note the conflicting IP and MAC addresses.</li>
          </ul>

          <h5>Step 2: Release and Renew the IP Address</h5>
          <p>If the device is using a dynamically assigned IP (via DHCP):</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Open the command prompt and release the IP address:</li>
            <pre><code>
ipconfig /release
</code></pre>
            <li>Request a new IP address from the DHCP server:</li>
            <pre><code>
ipconfig /renew
</code></pre>
            <li>This resolves the conflict by assigning a new, unique IP address.</li>
          </ul>

          <h5>Step 3: Check DHCP Server Configuration</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>Ensure the DHCP server is configured to provide non-overlapping IP addresses.</li>
            <li>Check the DHCP IP address range (scope) to confirm no manual/static IPs are within the DHCP range.</li>
          </ul>

          <h5>Step 4: Assign Static IP Addresses Properly</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>If devices use static IP addresses, ensure each one has a unique IP:</li>
            <pre><code>
Example:
Device 1 → 192.168.1.10
Device 2 → 192.168.1.11
</code></pre>
            <li>Document static IP assignments to avoid future conflicts.</li>
          </ul>

          <h5>Step 5: Restart Affected Devices</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>Restart the devices experiencing the conflict to ensure the changes take effect.</li>
            <li>Verify the IP addresses after restarting using the following command:</li>
            <pre><code>
ipconfig
</code></pre>
          </ul>

          <h5>Step 6: Check for Duplicate IP Assignments</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>Log in to the router or DHCP server to review all assigned IP addresses.</li>
            <li>Manually remove any conflicting entries or reassign the IP range.</li>
          </ul>

          <h5>Step 7: Update Network Configuration</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>Enable <strong>IP conflict detection</strong> on the DHCP server (if supported).</li>
            <li>Ensure the router and DHCP server firmware are up to date to prevent mismanagement.</li>
          </ul>

        <h3>33. Determining if a Website Unreachability Issue is DNS-Related</h3>
        <p>If a website is unreachable, the issue could be due to DNS failures, which prevent the domain name from being resolved to an IP address. To confirm if the problem is DNS-related, the following steps can be performed:</p>

        <article>
          <h4>33.1 Steps to Diagnose DNS-Related Issues</h4>

          <h5>Step 1: Ping the Website's Domain Name</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>Attempt to ping the website using its domain name:</li>
            <pre><code>
ping www.example.com
</code></pre>
            <li>If the response shows "could not find host" or "unknown host," it indicates a DNS resolution issue.</li>
            <li>If you receive replies, DNS is likely working correctly.</li>
          </ul>

          <h5>Step 2: Ping the Website's IP Address</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>Find the website's IP address using an online DNS lookup tool or cached data.</li>
            <li>Ping the IP address directly:</li>
            <pre><code>
ping 93.184.216.34
</code></pre>
            <li>If the ping is successful but the domain name fails, the problem is DNS-related.</li>
          </ul>

          <h5>Step 3: Use the <code>nslookup</code> Command</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>Run the <code>nslookup</code> command to query DNS servers for the website's IP address:</li>
            <pre><code>
nslookup www.example.com
</code></pre>
            <li><strong>Output Analysis</strong>:
              <ul>
                <li>If the response shows an IP address, DNS is working.</li>
                <li>If the response says "Non-existent domain" or "server failed," it confirms a DNS issue.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h5>Step 4: Check Alternate DNS Servers</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>Switch to a public DNS server (e.g., Google DNS: 8.8.8.8) to rule out issues with your current DNS server.</li>
            <li>Change DNS settings temporarily:
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Windows</strong>: Network Settings → Change Adapter Options → Set DNS to 8.8.8.8.</li>
                <li><strong>Command Line</strong> test:</li>
                <pre><code>
nslookup www.example.com 8.8.8.8
</code></pre>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>If this resolves the issue, the problem lies with the default DNS server.</li>
          </ul>

          <h5>Step 5: Test with the <code>tracert</code> or <code>dig</code> Command</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>Use the <code>tracert</code> (Windows) or <code>dig</code> (Linux/Mac) command to trace the route to the server and check for DNS failures:</li>
            <pre><code>
tracert www.example.com
</code></pre>
            <pre><code>
dig www.example.com
</code></pre>
            <li>If no route or DNS record is found, it confirms a DNS issue.</li>
          </ul>

          <h5>Step 6: Check DNS Cache</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>Clear the DNS cache in case of corrupted entries:</li>
            <pre><code>
ipconfig /flushdns
</code></pre>

        <h3>34. Command-Line Tools for Network Diagnostics</h3>
        <p>Command-line tools are essential for diagnosing and troubleshooting network issues. They help identify connectivity problems, DNS failures, routing errors, and more. Common tools include <strong>ping</strong>, <strong>tracert/traceroute</strong>, <strong>ipconfig/ifconfig</strong>, <strong>nslookup</strong>, and <strong>netstat</strong>.</p>

        <article>
          <h4>34.1 Explanation of Two Key Tools</h4>

          <h5>1. **ping**</h5>
          <p><strong>Purpose</strong>: The <code>ping</code> command checks the connectivity between a local device and a remote host by sending ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) echo requests.</p>

          <p><strong>How It Works:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>The command sends packets to a specified IP address or hostname.</li>
            <li>If the target is reachable, it replies with ICMP echo responses.</li>
            <li>The output shows round-trip time (RTT) in milliseconds, packet loss, and network latency.</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Syntax:</strong></p>
          <pre><code>
ping [IP Address/Domain Name]
</code></pre>

          <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
          <pre><code>
ping www.google.com
</code></pre>
          <p>This checks if <code>google.com</code> is reachable and measures latency.</p>

          <p><strong>Use Cases:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Verify network connectivity to a server or device.</li>
            <li>Check for packet loss or high latency.</li>
            <li>Diagnose local or external network issues.</li>
          </ul>

          <hr>

          <h5>2. **tracert (Windows) / traceroute (Linux/Mac)**</h5>
          <p><strong>Purpose</strong>: The <code>tracert</code> (or <code>traceroute</code>) command traces the path that packets take to reach a destination. It identifies each router (hop) along the route and measures latency at each step.</p>

          <p><strong>How It Works:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>The command sends packets with increasing Time-To-Live (TTL) values.</li>
            <li>Each router along the path decrements the TTL, and when it reaches zero, the router replies with an ICMP message.</li>
            <li>This process continues until the packet reaches the destination.</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Syntax:</strong></p>
          <pre><code>
tracert [IP Address/Domain Name]   (Windows)
traceroute [IP Address/Domain Name] (Linux/Mac)
</code></pre>

          <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
          <pre><code>
tracert www.google.com
</code></pre>

          <p>This shows all the intermediate routers (hops) between your device and <code>google.com</code>, including the response time at each hop.</p>

          <p><strong>Use Cases:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Diagnose network bottlenecks or delays.</li>
            <li>Identify where packets are being dropped in the network path.</li>
            <li>Understand the route traffic takes to a destination.</li>
          </ul>
        </article>

        <article>
          <h4>34.2 Summary</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>ping</strong>: Checks basic connectivity, latency, and packet loss.</li>
            <li><strong>tracert/traceroute</strong>: Traces the route to a destination and measures delays at each hop.</li>
          </ul>

          <h5>Key Takeaway:</h5>
          <p>These tools are vital for diagnosing network issues, identifying connectivity failures, and isolating problem areas in a network.</p>

        <h3>35. Scenario for Using Wireshark or Similar Network Monitoring Tools</h3>
        <p><strong>Wireshark</strong> is a powerful network protocol analyzer used to capture and inspect network traffic in real-time. It helps identify, analyze, and resolve various network-related issues.</p>

        <article>
          <h4>35.1 Scenario: Troubleshooting Slow Network Performance</h4>
          <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Users in an office complain that the network has become unusually slow, affecting productivity.</p>

          <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Identify the root cause of the slow network performance using Wireshark.</p>

          <h5>Steps to Use Wireshark:</h5>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Capture Network Traffic</strong>:
              <ul>
                <li>Install Wireshark on a computer connected to the network.</li>
                <li>Start capturing live traffic on the network interface.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Analyze Traffic Patterns</strong>:
              <ul>
                <li>Look for unusual traffic spikes or excessive bandwidth usage.</li>
                <li>Sort traffic by protocol or IP address to identify suspicious sources.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Identify the Root Cause</strong>:
              <ul>
                <li>Common issues that Wireshark can reveal include:</li>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Malware Infection</strong>: A compromised device sending abnormal traffic to an external IP.</li>
                  <li><strong>File Downloads</strong>: Large file transfers saturating network bandwidth.</li>
                  <li><strong>Broadcast Storms</strong>: Excessive ARP or broadcast packets slowing down the network.</li>
                  <li><strong>Application Misbehavior</strong>: Misconfigured applications generating high traffic.</li>
                </ul>
              </ul>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Filter and Isolate the Problem</strong>:
              <ul>
                <li>Apply filters to focus on specific IP addresses, protocols (e.g., HTTP, FTP), or packet sizes.</li>
                <li>Example Wireshark filters:</li>
                <pre><code>
ip.addr == 192.168.1.10   // Filter packets from a specific IP.
tcp.port == 80            // Focus on HTTP traffic.
</code></pre>
              </ul>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Take Action</strong>:
              <ul>
                <li>If malware is detected, isolate the infected device immediately.</li>
                <li>If a single application is causing excessive traffic, reconfigure or limit its bandwidth usage.</li>
                <li>Update firewall rules to block unwanted traffic from suspicious external IPs.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ol>
