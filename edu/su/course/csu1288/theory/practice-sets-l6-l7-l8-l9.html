                    <p><strong>1. Define Intrusion Prevention System (IPS).</strong><br><strong>Answer:</strong> IPS is a security tool that monitors network traffic and actively blocks or prevents malicious activities in real time.</p>
                    <p><strong>2. What is the main difference between IDS and IPS?</strong><br><strong>Answer:</strong> IDS only detects and alerts about threats, whereas IPS detects and automatically blocks or prevents threats.</p>
                    <p><strong>3. List any two limitations of IPS.</strong><br><strong>Answer:</strong> </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Can generate false positives and block legitimate traffic. </li>
                        <li>May degrade network performance due to inline deployment.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p><strong>4. Mention any two types of machine learning used in IDS.</strong><br><strong>Answer:</strong> </p>

                    <p><strong>6. Explain Anomaly-Based Detection with an example.</strong><br><strong>Answer:</strong><br>Anomaly-based detection builds a model of normal behavior and flags deviations.<br><em>Example:</em> A user normally logs in during office hours. If the user logs in at midnight from a different location, the IDS flags it as an anomaly.<br><strong>Advantages:</strong> Can detect unknown attacks.<br><strong>Limitations:</strong> High false positives due to dynamic user behavior.</p>

                    <p><strong>7. What are the advantages and limitations of Non-Credentialed Vulnerability Scanning?</strong><br><strong>Answer:</strong><br><strong>Advantages:</strong> </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Simulates external attacker’s perspective. </li>
                        <li>Easy to configure (no login required).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Limitations:</strong> </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Cannot access deep system configurations. </li>
                        <li>Higher chance of false positives or missed issues.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>8. Describe the Alert Generation and Response/Action phase in IDS Process Models.</strong><br><strong>Answer:</strong> </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Alert Generation:</strong> When an IDS detects a threat, it generates an alert based on detection rules or models. </li>
                        <li><strong>Response/Action:</strong> The system logs the event, notifies administrators, or integrates with other tools (like SIEM) to initiate countermeasures like isolation, blocking IPs, or updating rules.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>9. Write a short note on the integration of IPS with SIEM systems.</strong><br><strong>Answer:</strong> </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>SIEM collects and analyzes security data from various sources including IPS. </li>
                        <li>IPS provides real-time threat data to SIEM. </li>
                        <li>SIEM correlates IPS alerts with other logs for better visibility. </li>
                        <li>Helps in faster incident detection and response by centralizing data analysis.</li>

                    <p><strong>11. Explain the Deployment Strategies of IPS and discuss their pros and cons with suitable examples.</strong><br><strong>Answer:</strong> </p>
                    <p><strong>1. Inline Deployment:</strong> </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>IPS is placed directly in the path of network traffic. </li>
                        <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Immediate threat blocking. </li>
                        <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Can cause delays or single point of failure. </li>
                        <li><em>Example:</em> Deployed between router and internal network.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>2. Parallel Deployment (Out-of-Band):</strong> </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>IPS monitors mirrored traffic but doesn’t block directly. </li>
                        <li><strong>Pros:</strong> No network disruption. </li>
                        <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Cannot block threats in real-time. </li>
                        <li><em>Example:</em> Connected via SPAN port on a switch.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>3. Host-Based IPS:</strong> </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Installed on individual endpoints. </li>
                        <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Protects internal systems and stops insider threats. </li>
                        <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Difficult to manage on many devices. </li>
                        <li><em>Example:</em> IPS agent on a server or workstation.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Strategy selection depends on network architecture, performance requirements, and threat environment.</p>

                        <li>Reinforcement Learning (RL) in IDS involves an agent learning by interacting with the environment and receiving feedback. </li>
                        <li>The system learns optimal actions (like blocking traffic) based on rewards or penalties. </li>
                        <li>It adapts to changing threats over time. </li>
                        <li>Example: An IDS learns to block IPs that show repeated suspicious activity.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>7. What are the key benefits of using Process Models in IDS?</strong><br><strong>Answer:</strong> </p>

                    <p><strong>1. What is a false positive in an IDS, and why is it a problem?</strong><br><strong>Answer:</strong> A false positive occurs when the IDS wrongly identifies normal activity as a threat. It’s a problem because it can waste time, reduce trust in the system, and cause alert fatigue.</p>
                    <p><strong>2. Define vulnerability analysis in simple terms.</strong><br><strong>Answer:</strong> Vulnerability analysis is the process of finding weaknesses in a system that attackers could use to cause harm.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>IPS uses signature-based or protocol analysis methods to inspect data packets. </li>
                        <li>When a SQL pattern like <code>' OR 1=1 --</code> is detected in input fields, the IPS identifies it as malicious. </li>
                        <li>The IPS then blocks the packet, drops the connection, and alerts the administrator. </li>
                        <li>This helps prevent unauthorized access or data leakage.</li>

                    <p><strong>6. Explain the working of anomaly-based IPS with a real-life example.</strong><br><strong>Answer:</strong> </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Anomaly-based IPS learns normal behavior of network traffic. </li>
                        <li>It compares current activity to the learned baseline. </li>
                        <li>If the activity deviates significantly, it flags or blocks it.<br><em>Example:</em> A user normally downloads small files, but suddenly downloads 5 GB at midnight. IPS blocks it as an anomaly.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>7. Describe the architecture of IPS with the role of each component.</strong><br><strong>Answer:</strong> </p>
                    <ol>

                    <p><strong>11. Explain the IDS evaluation metrics (TP, FP, FN, Precision, Recall, F1-Score) in detail using a simple example.</strong><br><strong>Answer:</strong> </p>
                    <p><strong>Example Scenario:</strong><br>Out of 100 events, </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>40 were actual attacks. </li>
                        <li>IDS correctly detected 30 (TP). </li>
                        <li>Missed 10 real attacks (FN). </li>
                        <li>Raised 20 wrong alerts (FP).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Metrics:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>True Positive (TP):</strong> Real attacks correctly detected = 30 </li>
                        <li><strong>False Positive (FP):</strong> Normal actions wrongly flagged = 20 </li>
                        <li><strong>False Negative (FN):</strong> Real attacks missed = 10 </li>
                        <li><strong>Precision:</strong> TP / (TP + FP) = 30 / (30 + 20) = 0.6 </li>
                        <li><strong>Recall:</strong> TP / (TP + FN) = 30 / (30 + 10) = 0.75 </li>
                        <li><strong>F1-Score:</strong> 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)<br>= 2 * (0.6 * 0.75) / (0.6 + 0.75) ≈ 0.666</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Precision shows correctness of alerts. </li>
                        <li>Recall shows how well IDS detects actual threats. </li>

                    <p><strong>6. Explain the difference between detection and prevention in network security.</strong><br><strong>Answer:</strong> </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Detection:</strong> Identifies and alerts about malicious activity without stopping it (e.g., IDS). </li>
                        <li><strong>Prevention:</strong> Actively blocks or stops threats in real time (e.g., IPS).<br><strong>Example:</strong> An IDS detects a DDoS attempt; an IPS blocks the malicious traffic.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>7. Write a short note on machine learning models used in IDS.</strong><br><strong>Answer:</strong> </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Supervised Learning:</strong> Trained with labeled data (e.g., SVM, Decision Tree) to detect known attack types. </li>
                        <li><strong>Unsupervised Learning:</strong> Finds anomalies in unlabeled data (e.g., K-Means, Isolation Forest). </li>
                        <li><strong>Reinforcement Learning:</strong> Learns optimal response actions by interacting with the environment.<br><strong>Benefit:</strong> Adapts to new threats and improves detection accuracy.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>8. Describe how IPS integrates with firewalls and endpoint protection tools.</strong><br><strong>Answer:</strong> </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>With Firewalls:</strong> IPS adds deep-packet inspection beyond firewall rules. It blocks threats the firewall might miss. </li>
                        <li><strong>With Endpoints:</strong> Works with antivirus/EDR to monitor behavior locally and network-wide. </li>
                        <li><strong>Integration Benefits:</strong> Better coordination, layered defense, reduced gaps in coverage.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>9. Explain the process of anomaly detection using baseline profiling with an example.</strong><br><strong>Answer:</strong> </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Baseline Creation:</strong> System learns normal behavior (e.g., login time, file access). </li>
                        <li><strong>Monitoring:</strong> Current behavior is compared to the baseline. </li>
                        <li><strong>Detection:</strong> Significant deviation is flagged as a possible threat.<br><strong>Example:</strong> A user logs in at midnight from a new location — flagged as anomaly.</li>

                        <li>ML models learn from real-world data and improve detection accuracy. </li>
                        <li>By analyzing patterns of normal and malicious behavior, ML can distinguish between real threats and safe anomalies. </li>
                        <li>Supervised learning helps classify events correctly, while unsupervised learning finds hidden threats without prior labeling. </li>
                        <li>Example: A model trained to ignore large file transfers during backup times avoids false alerts.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>8. Explain the importance of integrating IPS with a SIEM tool.</strong><br><strong>Answer:</strong> </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>SIEM aggregates data from various sources, including IPS. </li>
                        <li>IPS alerts sent to SIEM are correlated with logs from other systems (firewalls, servers, etc.). </li>
                        <li>This provides a complete view of threats and helps prioritize responses. </li>
                        <li>Improves incident detection, investigation, and compliance reporting.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>9. How does the use of baseline behavior help anomaly-based IDS detect threats?</strong><br><strong>Answer:</strong> </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Baseline behavior represents normal activity patterns. </li>
                        <li>Anomaly-based IDS compares current activity to this baseline. </li>
                        <li>Any significant deviation is flagged as suspicious. </li>
                        <li>Example: If a user suddenly downloads hundreds of files, it's detected as an anomaly.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>6. Explain how protocol-aware detection helps in reducing false alerts in modern traffic inspection.</strong><br><strong>Answer:</strong> </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Protocol-aware detection understands the expected structure and behavior of specific protocols (e.g., HTTP, DNS). </li>
                        <li>It distinguishes between normal and suspicious use, avoiding misinterpretation of legitimate variations. </li>
                        <li>Reduces false positives caused by malformed but non-malicious packets. </li>
                        <li>Enables deeper inspection at the application layer for protocol misuse or tunneling.</li>

                    <h3 class="d-print-none">Section A - Short Answer Questions (5 * 2 = 10 Marks)</h3>
                    <p><strong>1. What is anomaly scoring, and how is it different from binary threat classification?</strong><br><strong>Answer:</strong> Anomaly scoring assigns a risk score to events based on their deviation from normal behavior, while binary classification labels events as simply "normal" or "malicious," without ranking severity.</p>
                    <p><strong>2. Define time-to-detection (TTD) and explain its significance in intrusion response.</strong><br><strong>Answer:</strong> TTD is the time taken to detect an intrusion after it occurs. Lower TTD enables faster containment, reducing damage and recovery time.</p>
                    <p><strong>3. What is meant by microsegmentation in networks, and how does it relate to detection scope?</strong><br><strong>Answer:</strong> Microsegmentation divides a network into small, isolated zones. It narrows the detection scope, making lateral movement more visible and attacks easier to contain.</p>
                    <p><strong>4. Name two ways deception grids improve threat hunting capabilities.</strong><br><strong>Answer:</strong> </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>They lure attackers into fake environments, revealing intent and tactics. </li>
                        <li>They create false targets, allowing analysts to trace intrusion paths without risking real assets.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p><strong>5. What does “kill chain disruption” refer to in the context of proactive detection?</strong><br><strong>Answer:</strong> It involves identifying and interrupting steps in an attack lifecycle (like reconnaissance or lateral movement) before the attacker completes their objective.</p>

                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>9. What role does temporal data analysis play in detecting slow-developing multi-stage attacks?</strong><br><strong>Answer:</strong> </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Tracks events over time to identify patterns that might be missed in single-point detections. </li>
                        <li>Detects gradual privilege escalation or staged data exfiltration. </li>

                    <p><strong>6. Explain the use of colored alerts (e.g., green, yellow, red) in visual dashboards for intrusion detection systems.</strong><br><strong>Answer:</strong> </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Green:</strong> Normal or safe activity; no action needed. </li>
                        <li><strong>Yellow:</strong> Warning or suspicious activity; requires attention. </li>
                        <li><strong>Red:</strong> Confirmed or high-risk attack; needs immediate response.<br>Color coding helps staff quickly understand threat levels and respond faster.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>7. How can basic port scanning activity be flagged using IDS?</strong><br><strong>Answer:</strong> </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>IDS can monitor for repeated connection attempts to many ports in a short time. </li>
                        <li>If an external IP tries accessing unused ports or multiple services, it triggers an alert. </li>
                        <li>Tools like Snort can use port-scan detection rules to log and block such scans.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>8. Discuss the importance of updating threat detection rules in small business IDS setups.</strong><br><strong>Answer:</strong> </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>New threats appear frequently; outdated rules miss them. </li>
                        <li>Updating ensures the IDS can detect recent malware or attack patterns. </li>
                        <li>Small businesses are often targets due to weak security, so regular updates are critical. </li>
                        <li>Many tools offer automatic updates to make this easier.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>1. How do timing side-channels affect the detection reliability of IPS under encrypted traffic flows?</strong><br><strong>Answer:</strong> They leak sensitive timing patterns even in encrypted traffic, which attackers can use to mimic benign behavior and evade IPS detection.</p>
                    <p><strong>2. Why is memory forensics rarely integrated into live IDS/IPS systems, and what risks does this pose?</strong><br><strong>Answer:</strong> It is resource-intensive and disrupts system performance; this omission allows fileless malware and in-memory attacks to go undetected in real time.</p>
                    <p><strong>3. How can cross-layer evasion strategies render multi-modal IDS ineffective?</strong><br><strong>Answer:</strong> Attackers spread indicators across layers (e.g., app + network) to stay under detection thresholds at each layer, defeating isolated or poorly-correlated IDS models.</p>
                    <p><strong>4. Explain why high entropy in traffic patterns is a red flag and how anomaly detectors struggle to quantify it.</strong><br><strong>Answer:</strong> High entropy suggests encrypted or obfuscated payloads; anomaly detectors often lack contextual baselines to distinguish legitimate encryption from malicious obfuscation.</p>
                    <p><strong>5. Why is zero-trust architecture inherently in conflict with traditional perimeter-based IDS models?</strong><br><strong>Answer:</strong> Zero-trust assumes no trusted internal zones, while perimeter IDS focuses on border monitoring, making it blind to internal lateral threats.</p>

                    <h3 class="d-print-none">Section A - Short Answer Questions (5 * 2 = 10 Marks)</h3>
                    <p><strong>1. Why does the lack of causal explainability in deep learning-based IDS models pose a regulatory risk in critical infrastructure?</strong><br><strong>Answer:</strong> Regulatory bodies require traceable and explainable decisions, especially in safety-critical systems; black-box models cannot justify actions, risking non-compliance and system shutdowns.</p>
                    <p><strong>2. How does protocol mutation by attackers undermine deterministic detection engines in IPS?</strong><br><strong>Answer:</strong> Attackers manipulate protocol behavior (e.g., malformed headers) to bypass rule-based engines expecting strict RFC-compliance, evading detection.</p>
                    <p><strong>3. What is the significance of “alert prioritization algorithms” in preventing threat overload in real-time SOCs?</strong><br><strong>Answer:</strong> They rank alerts by threat level and asset value, reducing analyst fatigue, focusing on high-impact risks, and ensuring timely incident response.</p>
                    <p><strong>4. How does dynamic container scaling interfere with host-based IDS trace consistency?</strong><br><strong>Answer:</strong> Frequent creation/destruction of containers leads to inconsistent process IDs, ephemeral logs, and gaps in behavioral baselines, confusing host-based IDS.</p>
                    <p><strong>5. Why is detection of time-slow attacks (e.g., low-and-slow DDoS or data exfiltration) fundamentally challenging for rate-based IPS?</strong><br><strong>Answer:</strong> These attacks operate below configured thresholds, exploiting temporal gaps in detection logic, making them appear like normal behavior over time.</p>

                            <p><strong>Non-Credentialed Scans:</strong> </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Used for external-facing systems. </li>
                                <li>Identifies open ports, exposed services. </li>
                                <li>Simulates attacker’s view.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Design Approach:</strong> </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Schedule regular credentialed scans during low-traffic periods. </li>
                        <li>Run non-credentialed scans frequently on public servers. </li>
                        <li>Use scan results to prioritize patching and hardening. </li>
                        <li>Maintain separate scan reports for compliance and incident readiness.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Justification:</strong><br>Combines internal depth with external perspective, ensuring comprehensive security coverage. Reduces risk from both insider threats and external attackers.</p>
