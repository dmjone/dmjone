                    <h3>2. Fun Things a Computer Can Do</h3>
                    <p>Computers can do many fun things:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Play music and videos.</li>
                        <li>Let you draw and color.</li>
                        <li>Play games with you.</li>
                        <li>Help you learn with fun apps.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>2.1 Operating Systems</h4>
                    <p>For all the fun tasks a computer can do, it needs an Operating System (OS) like Windows, Mac OS, or Linux. Think of it as the boss that manages everything on the computer.</p>

                    <h3>3. Telling the Computer What To Do</h3>
                    <p>Computers are smart, but they need instructions. We give them instructions using something called "programming".</p>
                    <h4>3.1 Simple Instructions</h4>
                    <p>Let's say you have a toy robot. You can push a button to make it move forward or turn. Programming a computer is like giving instructions to that toy robot.</p>
                    <h4>3.2 Computer's Language</h4>
                    <p>Computers have their own language. But don't worry! There are tools that let us talk to computers using words we understand, and then they translate it for the computer.</p>
                    <h4>3.3 Understanding Programs</h4>
                    <p>A program is a set of instructions that tells the computer what to do. It's like a recipe. And just like there are different recipes, there are different programming languages to write these instructions.</p>

                <article id="intro-to-logic">
                    <h3>4. Making Choices</h3>
                    <p>Just like you decide whether to wear a jacket on a cold day or eat ice cream when it's hot, computers also make choices. But they need our help to decide!</p>
                    <h4>4.1 Simple Decisions</h4>
                    <p>If we tell a computer, "If it's raining, show a picture of an umbrella", the computer will check if it's raining and then show the picture if it is.</p>
                    <h4>4.2 Repeating Tasks</h4>
                    <p>Imagine clapping your hands five times. Instead of telling the computer "clap" five times, we can say "clap" and then tell it to repeat that 5 times. This is how we make the computer do things over and over.</p>
                    <h4>4.3 Algorithms</h4>
                    <p>An algorithm is a step-by-step plan to solve a problem. Before we tell a computer what to do, we often plan it out with an algorithm, ensuring the computer does its tasks in the right order.</p>

                    <h3>6. How Computers Think</h3>
                    <p>Computers, though smart, think differently than we do. They follow the exact instructions we give them, without guessing or imagining.</p>
                    <h4>6.1 Binary Language</h4>
                    <p>While we understand words and numbers, computers have their own simple language made of just two numbers: 0 and 1. Everything you see on a computer, from pictures to games, is made up of these numbers!</p>
                    <h4>6.2 Memory</h4>
                    <p>Just like we remember things, computers have a memory too. They remember what we tell them and can use that information later. But if we turn them off, they might forget some things unless we ask them to remember permanently (like saving a game).</p>
                    <h4>6.3 Logic Gates</h4>
                    <p>At the heart of how computers think are logic gates. These gates take simple decisions based on the binary language (0s and 1s) and are the building blocks for all computer operations.</p>

                    <h4>6.4 Understanding Binary</h4>
                    <p>At its core, every computer understands only two values: 0 and 1. This system is called binary. Just like we use numbers and letters to represent information, computers use sequences of 0s and 1s to store and process data. Everything on a computer, from pictures to games, is made up of these numbers. The smallest unit in this system is a bit (0 or 1) and eight of these bits make a byte.</p>

                    <h4>6.5 Digital vs. Analog</h4>
                    <p>Computers represent and process information differently from analog devices. For instance, digital clocks show precise numerical time, while analog clocks use hour and minute hands.</p>

                    <p>You can also talk to some computers! You might say, "Play my favorite song", and the computer will start playing music.</p>
                    <h4>7.3 Cameras and Movement</h4>
                    <p>Some computers have cameras that can see you. With special games, you can move your body, and the computer will understand and react!</p>
                    <h4>7.4 The Command Line</h4>
                    <p>Before there were fancy screens with icons, people interacted with computers using text commands. This command line interface is still used by programmers and tech experts for many tasks because of its power and simplicity.</p>
                    <h4>7.5 GUI vs. CLI</h4>
                    <p>There are different ways users can interact with a computer. GUI is like interacting through visuals (icons, windows), while CLI is where you type text-based commands.</p>

                    <h4>7.6 Basic Troubleshooting</h4>
                    <p>Before diving deep into computers, knowing some basic troubleshooting steps can be empowering. Simple steps like "turning it off and on again" or "checking all connections" can solve a lot of basic issues.</p>
