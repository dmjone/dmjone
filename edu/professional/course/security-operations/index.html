                            The weakest link in any organization is humans. Therefore, each of us must seriously consider our security responsibilities, regardless of whether we are the new intern or the executive in the corner office.

                                        Security Awareness Training is the process of training users to recognize potential or attempted attacks and educating them on the correct responses to such events. It also involves education on company policies and procedures, particularly in areas such as data handling and emergency response activities.

                                        The purpose of Security Awareness Training is to ensure that all employees understand their roles and responsibilities within the organization's security framework. This training aims to identify and address any carelessness or complacency among staff that may pose a risk to the organization, reinforcing the importance of adhering to policies and procedures.

                                        Security training is important because it significantly reduces the risk of successful attacks, such as those involving social engineering. By enabling employees and staff to recognize security threats and understand how to operate securely, the organization strengthens its overall security stance.
