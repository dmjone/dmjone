    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dmjone/dmjone.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd dmjone
    ```

## Deployment

The `dmj.one` website is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages and Cloudflare Pages upon pushing changes to the repository. This section describes the deployment process in detail, including safety and security checks.

### GitHub Pages

The site is hosted on GitHub Pages. Follow these steps to ensure proper deployment:

1. **Enable GitHub Pages**:
   1. Go to your repository settings.
   2. In the "Pages" section, set the source to the `main` branch or a specific folder like `/docs`.

### Safety and Security Checks

Before deployment, a series of safety and security checks are performed to ensure the integrity and security of the codebase. These checks include:

1. **Code Quality Checks**:
   1. Automated code quality tools such as CodeQL are used to analyze the code for potential vulnerabilities and code quality issues.
   
2. **Security Scanning**:
   1. Security scanning tools are integrated to detect and prevent vulnerabilities in the codebase.
